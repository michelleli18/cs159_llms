	"reasoning": "All subitems were placed to ensure optimal use of available space and logical urban planning. The 'Stadium' and 'Airport Terminal,' being the largest subitems, were placed together in the north due to their significant size and the need to handle large crowds and heavy traffic flow, ensuring their proximity to facilitate transportation convenience. 'City Park', as a recreational area, is placed next to 'Airport Terminal' to provide leisure options for travelers and locals alike. 'High School' was positioned directly south of the 'Stadium' and 'Airport Terminal' to ensure it's centrally located for easy access while leaving space for community amenities like 'Library' and 'Museum'. The 'Library' is smaller and positioned next to 'High School' for educational convenience. The 'Museum' covers a large area to the east and is near the 'City Park' to form a cultural and recreational hub. The 'Hospital' is placed centrally in the lower half of the map for accessibility during emergencies, with the 'Police Station' and 'Fire Station' nearby, ensuring quick emergency response times. All spaces are used efficiently, leaving areas in between for pedestrian pathways and open space to ensure a realistic urban layout without any overlap and with logical adjacencies."

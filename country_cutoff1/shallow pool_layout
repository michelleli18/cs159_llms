    "reasoning": "Each subitem's placement was carefully considered to ensure efficient use of space within the shallow pool area while adhering to the rules about coordinates and avoiding overlap. The 'pool area' was given the largest space and centrally located at the top to mimic a natural layout where the pool is the main feature. The 'lounge chairs' were placed near the pool for quick access and comfort, followed by the 'shade umbrella' directly next to the lounge chairs to provide shade. The 'towel station' and 'refreshment kiosks' were placed at the lower part of the area for easy access to towels and refreshments near the exits. This arrangement uses the coordinates efficiently while ensuring a logical flow and ensuring that items typically found together in real life, such as lounge chairs with shade umbrellas, are next to each other. Regarding the sizes, the pool area naturally occupies the most space, reflecting its importance. The refreshment kiosks are smaller, reflecting their function as utility areas, but still cover significant width to provide accessibility."

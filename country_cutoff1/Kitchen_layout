    "reasoning": "The kitchen's layout is designed to be realistic and space-efficient. The Refrigerator, Oven, Sink, Countertop, and Dishwasher are placed in a row from left to right along the top part of the kitchen. This logically follows the workflow of preparing, cooking, cleaning, and storage which are usually close to each other for convenience. The Pantry and Cabinets are placed below the Refrigerator and Sink respectively to allow easy access to food items and utensils. The Kitchen Island and Dining Table are placed adjacent to each other, allowing for both food preparation and dining spaces. Due to space constraints, there was no uncovered floor space and all subitems fit snugly around the perimeter. The sizes of each item reflect their respective roles and frequency of use within the kitchen, with larger items like the Refrigerator and Dining Table occupying more space as they serve more critical functions. Items were placed such that their coordinates stay within the boundaries of the kitchen's coordinates without any overlap."

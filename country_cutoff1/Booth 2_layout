"reasoning": "The placement of each subitem in Booth 2 has been designed to maximize the use of space while considering logical and practical proximity for users. The tables are placed adjacent to each other in pairs to facilitate group seating and communal dining experiences, which is common in modern booth designs. Benches are placed end-to-end along the north side of the tables, providing easy access and ensuring guests have sufficient seating space. The dividers are strategically positioned to separate different sections of the booth, maintaining some degree of privacy and organization within the limited space constraints. The menu boards are positioned at the entrance area of the booth, allowing easy viewing for customers as they enter. The arrangement ensures that no subitems overlap while utilizing nearly the entire available space efficiently. This layout respects the architectural priorities of space efficiency, accessibility, and logical item placement based on their functional relationships and typical usage patterns."

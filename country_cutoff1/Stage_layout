  "reasoning": "To follow the set priorities and ensure efficient and realistic placement:
  1. Most importantly, all child item coordinates are maintained within the parent coordinates following bottom_left_corner_x <= x <= top_right_corner_x and bottom_left_corner_y <= y <= top_right_corner_y.
  2. The largest item, 'Stage Floor', covers the most area and is placed centrally to represent the main performance area.
  3. 'Audience Seating' is adjacent and towards the left, allowing direct view of the stage.
  4. 'Backdrop' is placed centrally at the rear, behind 'Stage Floor,' contributing to the visual narrative of the performance.
  5. 'Curtains' are placed logically adjacent to the 'Stage Floor', simulating their real-life positions.
  6. 'Lighting Rig' is towards the right and slightly above 'Stage Floor' to ensure natural lighting setup.
  7. 'Control Booth,' being the smallest item, is placed next to the 'Lighting Rig' for operational efficiency and to not obstruct other items.
  The varied sizes and logical grouping ensure modern, space-efficient usage without overlaps and cover almost all available area, adhering to the priorities set."

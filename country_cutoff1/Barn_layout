    "reasoning": "The placement of the subitems ensures that the larger spaces are allocated to the more essential parts of the barn. The 'Stalls' are placed on the left side occupying a large area because it is vital for housing animals, requiring ample space. Adjacent to the 'Stalls' is the 'Hayloft', positioned next to it for easy access to feed. The 'Feed Room' and 'Tack Room' are placed next to each other near the 'Hayloft', since it makes sense to store animal feed close to where the animals are housed and the tack supplies. The 'Barn Door' is placed on the bottom side to facilitate easy entry and exit, making it convenient for moving animals and materials in and out. The 'Storage Area' is located next to the 'Barn Door' for efficiency in storing and accessing items directly from the entry point. All subitems are placed without overlapping and ensure optimal use of space within the barn's coordinates."

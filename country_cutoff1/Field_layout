"reasoning": "The field's coordinates extend from [-50, 0, 10, 50]. The Barn, being the largest subitem and often a central structure in a field, is positioned to one side at [-50, 30, 0, 50], ensuring it's easily accessible and using a significant portion of the area. The Cornfield takes up a large space extending from [-20, 0, 10, 30], making it accessible and central. The Pond, an essential water source, is positioned at [-50, 0, -20, 20] for easy access from anywhere in the field. The Shed, used for smaller storage, is positioned at [0, 20, 10, 30], near the Barn but not taking up too much space. Finally, the Haystack, while not as large, is placed at [0, 0, 10, 20], making use of the remaining space efficiently. This arrangement ensures optimal use of space, logical placements based on functionality, and avoids overlaps while mimicking real-life logic."

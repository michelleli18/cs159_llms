    "reasoning": "The Entertainment Center is placed at the top left of the living room and is the largest item, fitting comfortably along the top wall. The TV Stand is placed next to it to maximize functionality and natural living room layout. The Sofa, being one of the larger items, spans almost the entire width of the room maximizing seating space and is situated right below the TV Stand and Entertainment Center allowing optimal viewing angle. The Coffee Table is placed centrally and adjacent to the Sofa for convenience. The Armchair is positioned to the bottom left and near the Sofa allowing for supplementary seating. The Bookshelf is placed next to the Armchair, providing easy access to books or decorative items. The items are laid out to ensure no overlaps and all space is utilized efficiently, with empty spaces only between the items to allow walking paths."

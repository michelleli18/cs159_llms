Yumiko Tanaka is a 29-year-old Japanese environmental scientist living in Kyoto. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys sculpting intricate miniatures of wildlife in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into urban gardening as well because she wants to incorporate more green spaces into her city lifestyle. She does not like noisy environments because they make it difficult for her to concentrate on her meticulous work. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include developing sustainable urban ecosystems and promoting environmental education in urban schools. Personally, she owns an expansive collection of vintage kimonos and a small, yet diverse aquarium at her home. Outside of home, she works at an ecological research center that collaborates with local governments on sustainability projects. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places like local parks and botanical gardens to do all her hobbies.

Evangeline Mart√≠nez is a 34-year-old Mexican-American marine biologist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys scuba diving, reading poetry, and volunteering at animal shelters in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into astrophotography and ceramics because she finds the vastness of space fascinating and wants to create tangible art pieces with her hands. She does not like spicy food because it upsets her stomach. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a book on marine ecosystems and starting a conservation foundation. Personally, she owns a modest collection of rare seashells and an extensive library of classic literature at her home. Outside of home, she works at a marine research institute. After work, she enjoys planning trips to coastal areas to do all her hobbies.

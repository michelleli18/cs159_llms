Cassandra El-Mofty is a 34-year-old Egyptian-American urban planner. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys practicing calligraphy and roller skating in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into gardening and bird-watching as well because she finds tranquility in nature and wants to cultivate a peaceful environment at home. She does not like crowded places because they make her feel anxious and overstimulated. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include designing eco-friendly urban spaces and advocating for sustainable development policies. Personally, she owns a collection of rare succulents and vintage maps at her home. Outside of home, she works at a municipal planning department. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different public parks and green spaces to do all her hobbies.

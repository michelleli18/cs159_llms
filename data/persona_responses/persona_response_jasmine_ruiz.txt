Jasmine Ruiz is a 34-year-old Mexican-American marine biologist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys diving into underwater caves and researching marine ecosystems in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into photography and learning French because she believes capturing the beauty of nature and understanding more languages can help bridge cultural gaps and inspire more people about marine conservation. She does not like loud, crowded places because they overwhelm her sensory sensitivities and disrupt her contemplation of nature. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include writing a comprehensive book on the behavioral patterns of deep-sea creatures and starting a marine conservation non-profit organization. Personally, she owns a collection of rare seashells, an aquarium filled with exotic fish, and an old but reliable camera at her home. Outside of home, she works at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, engaging in both research and education. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different coastal areas and underwater locales to do all her hobbies.

Clara Martínez is a 34-year-old Spanish-American environmental scientist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys hiking in national parks and painting landscapes in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into wildlife photography as well because she wants to capture the beauty of the ecosystems she studies. She does not like crowded urban areas because she finds them overwhelming and disconnected from nature. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a book on sustainable living and starting a community garden in her city. Personally, she owns a small collection of bonsai trees and a rescue greyhound at her home. Outside of home, she works at a renewable energy research facility. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different parks and wildlife reserves to do all her hobbies.

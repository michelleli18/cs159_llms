Dominic Adebayo is a 34-year-old Nigerian-American software engineer currently based in Seattle. His pronouns are he/him. He enjoys cooking experimental fusion cuisine and participating in community theater in his free time. However, he has also thought about expanding his interests into woodworking because he has always admired handcrafted furniture and the patience it requires. He does not like social media because he believes it often promotes superficial connections and comparisons. He has also been working hard towards his long-term goals and dreams, which include creating an educational technology startup that specializes in bringing coding to underprivileged schools in Africa. Personally, he owns an extensive collection of vintage records and a set of professional chef knives at his home. Outside of home, he works at a bustling tech start-up that focuses on artificial intelligence. After work, he enjoys planning to go to different places to do all his hobbies, whether it's checking out a new farmer's market for fresh ingredients or attending a local woodshop class to hone new skills.

Jean-Claude Dubois is a 37-year-old Franco-Malagasy anthropologist currently living in Porto, Portugal. His pronouns are he/him. He enjoys hiking through ancient ruins, practicing Capoeira, and cooking fusion cuisines in his free time. However, he has also thought about expanding his interests into wood carving and songbird watching as well because he feels deeply connected to nature and finds solitude in its beauty. He does not like loud, crowded places because they disrupt his inner peace and focus. He has also been working hard towards his long-term goals and dreams, which include earning a professorship in cultural anthropology, writing a comprehensive book on indigenous musical traditions, and establishing a community center in Madagascar that promotes traditional arts and crafts.

Personally, he owns a collection of rare, antique musical instruments, a small garden where he grows medicinal herbs, and an extensive library of ethnographic works at his home. Outside of home, he works at the University of Porto as a senior research fellow. After work, he enjoys planning to go to different remote villages to do all his hobbies, often meticulously organizing trips that combine his love for hiking, cultural exploration, and culinary experiences.

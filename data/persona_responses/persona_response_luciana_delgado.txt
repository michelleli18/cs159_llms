Luciana Delgado is a 27-year-old Mexican-American software engineer. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys painting abstract art and hiking in national parks during her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into learning to play the cello and studying marine biology because she loves the soothing sounds of classical music and is fascinated by ocean life. She does not like crowded places because they make her feel overwhelmed and anxious. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include becoming a lead developer at a tech company and starting a nonprofit organization to support young women in STEM fields. Personally, she owns a collection of rare succulents, a library of sci-fi novels, and a small parrot named Paco at her home. Outside of home, she works at an innovative tech startup that focuses on AI solutions. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to hike new trails and find inspiration for her paintings.

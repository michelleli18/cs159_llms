Matilda Rainier-Glaw is a 34-year-old Franco-Japanese cultural anthropologist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys collecting rare vinyl records, exploring urban ruins, and creating intricate hand-drawn maps in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into digital art and animation as well because she believes it would merge her love for history with modern storytelling techniques. She does not like fast fashion because she finds it environmentally harmful and ethically questionable. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include establishing her own foundation to preserve endangered cultures and to document their oral histories. Personally, she owns a library of over 10,000 books, a vintage Vespa scooter, and an extensive collection of traditional kimonos at her home. Outside of home, she works at a renowned international research institute, often traveling to remote locations for her studies. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to find new inspiration for all her hobbies.

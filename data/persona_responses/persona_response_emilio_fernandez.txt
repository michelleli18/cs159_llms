However, he has also thought about expanding his interests into woodworking and meditation as well because he finds hands-on crafts and mindfulness therapeutic. He does not like crowded places because they make him anxious and overwhelmed. He has also been working hard towards his long-term goals and dreams, which include developing an open-source platform for emerging artists and traveling to all seven continents.

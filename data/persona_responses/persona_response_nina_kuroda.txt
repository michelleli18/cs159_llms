Nina Kuroda is a 27-year-old Japanese-Brazilian photojournalist currently based in São Paulo. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys practicing aerial yoga and exploring urban photography in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into underwater photography because she loves the way light interacts with water and has always been fascinated by marine life. She does not like loud, crowded places because they overwhelm her sensory processing and make her feel anxious.

Nina has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a photo book of hidden gems in South American cities and starting a non-profit that teaches photography to underprivileged youth. Personally, she owns an impressive collection of vintage cameras and a small bonsai tree collection at her home. Outside of home, she works at a bustling media agency known for its innovative storytelling.

After work, Nina enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies; whether it's a new park for a yoga session or an unexplored alleyway that promises interesting photographic subjects, she thrives on discovering the unseen and capturing it through her lens.

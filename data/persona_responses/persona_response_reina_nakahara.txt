Reina Nakahara is a 29-year-old Japanese-American marine biologist currently living in Seattle. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys diving, painting ocean landscapes, and practicing taiko drumming in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into astrophotography and pottery because she finds the night sky fascinating and appreciates the mindfulness that crafting ceramics brings. She does not like loud, crowded places because they make her feel overwhelmed and drained. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include leading a significant conservation project to protect coral reefs and authoring a book on marine ecology. Personally, she owns a collection of vibrant seashells and a carefully maintained saltwater aquarium at her home. Outside of home, she works at the Marine Science Center. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different coastal spots to do all her hobbies.

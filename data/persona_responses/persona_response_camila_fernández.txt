Camila Fern√°ndez is a 32-year-old mixed-race woman from San Juan, Puerto Rico, currently working as a marine biologist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys kayaking, salsa dancing, and painting seascapes in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into astrophotography and quantum physics because she is fascinated by the mysteries of the universe and loves a good intellectual challenge. She does not like loud, crowded places because they make her feel overwhelmed and drain her energy rapidly. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a groundbreaking research paper on coral regeneration, traveling to all seven continents, and opening a marine conservation-focused art gallery. Personally, she owns a collection of vintage cameras, a pet tortoise named Galileo, and a cozy beachfront bungalow filled with maritime decorations and plants at her home. Outside of home, she works at a prestigious marine research institute located along the Caribbean coastline. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies, including checking out remote beaches for her kayaking and painting expeditions, and attending local salsa fiestas.

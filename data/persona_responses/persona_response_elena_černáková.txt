Elena Černáková is a 37-year-old Slovak-American marine biologist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys scuba diving, birdwatching, and reading science-fiction novels in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into astrophotography as well because she finds the night sky profoundly captivating and wants to combine her passion for science with her love for art. She does not like loud places because they make her feel overwhelmed and anxious due to her sensitivity to noise. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a book on marine ecosystems and starting a conservation program to protect endangered marine species. Personally, Elena owns a collection of antique maps, a telescope, and an indoor herb garden at her home. Outside of home, she works at an oceanographic institute in California. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different coastal locations to do all her hobbies.

Liana Makoto is a 29-year-old Japanese-Argentinian cultural anthropologist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys practicing traditional Japanese tea ceremonies, urban gardening, and playing the bandoneon in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into paragliding and pottery because she seeks thrilling experiences and the tactile pleasure of working with clay. She does not like crowded shopping malls because they make her feel claustrophobic and overwhelmed. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include establishing a cross-cultural exchange program and publishing a book on the syncretism of Argentine and Japanese traditions. Personally, she owns an impressive collection of rare botanical books and a set of antique tea cups at her home. Outside of home, she works at the National Museum of Ethnology. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places, such as local parks and workshops, to do all her hobbies.

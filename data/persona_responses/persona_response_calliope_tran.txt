Calliope Tran is a 31-year-old Vietnamese-American environmental engineer. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys painting abstract art and hiking in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into learning how to play the theremin as well because it fascinates her with its unusual, ethereal sound and the challenge it presents. She does not like crowds because they make her feel overwhelmed and anxious. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include developing sustainable energy solutions for urban areas and opening a community art gallery. Personally, she owns a quirky collection of vintage teapots and an impressive array of succulents at her home. Outside of home, she works at a cutting-edge environmental consultancy firm in San Francisco. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies, often seeking out new trails to hike and secluded spots to set up her easel and paint.

Amina López-Garcia is a 34-year-old second-generation Mexican-American urban planner based in Seattle, Washington. Their pronouns are she/her. She enjoys practicing calligraphy, exploring new culinary recipes, and playing the cello in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into learning kintsugi and rock climbing because she believes in finding beauty in imperfection and challenging herself physically as well as mentally. She does not like crowded tourist spots during peak seasons because she values tranquility and the opportunity to connect more meaningfully with her surroundings. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include designing sustainable and inclusive urban spaces, writing a cookery book highlighting her fusion recipes, and hosting a solo cello recital. Personally, she owns a small collection of rare succulents and an array of vintage calligraphy pens at her home. Outside of home, she works at a progressive urban design firm that focuses on eco-friendly urban solutions. After work, she enjoys planning to visit different neighborhoods to seek out unique architectural spaces and hidden gem eateries, integrating her love for urban planning and culinary exploration into every adventure.

Maya Sinclair is a 33-year-old Afro-Brazilian architect currently living in Copenhagen. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys doing aerial silk acrobatics and painting urban landscapes in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into learning to play the didgeridoo as well because she loves its unique sound and the challenge of mastering a new instrument. She does not like crowded places because they make her feel overwhelmed and claustrophobic. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include designing sustainable, eco-friendly buildings and creating art installations that merge architecture with environmental awareness. Personally, she owns a collection of vintage globes and succulents at her home. Outside of home, she works at an avant-garde architectural firm known for its innovative projects. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies, such as local parks for inspiration or hidden art galleries for new techniques.

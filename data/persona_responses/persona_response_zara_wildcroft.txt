Zara Wildcroft is a 29-year-old British-Jamaican multimedia artist and environmental activist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys creating intricate mixed-media collages and painting murals in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into sustainable fashion design because she believes in the power of fashion to make social statements and push boundaries. She does not like fast food because she is passionate about organic, locally-sourced ingredients and the importance of mindful consumption. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include establishing a community art center that doubles as an eco-friendly hub for artists to collaborate on sustainability projects. Personally, she owns a collection of vintage cameras and a small home garden where she grows herbs and vegetables. Outside of home, she works at a non-profit organization dedicated to environmental justice. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different nature reserves and community art galleries to practice birdwatching and gain inspiration for her next art projects.

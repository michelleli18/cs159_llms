Alexandra Norrick is a 33-year-old environmental scientist from New Zealand. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys hiking through the lesser-explored trails of national parks and painting abstract landscapes in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into urban gardening and composing ambient music because she finds solace and inspiration in blending natural and urban elements. She does not like crowded city centers because they make her feel overwhelmed and disconnected from nature. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a research paper on climate change adaptation strategies and opening a community art gallery that features eco-friendly artwork.

Personally, she owns a small collection of vintage botanical prints and a variety of hiking gear at her home. Outside of home, she works at the Institute for Environmental Sustainability. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies, whether that's exploring a new trail, tending to her indoor jungle of plants, or finding unique spots in the city to set up her easel and paint.

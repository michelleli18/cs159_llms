Anaya Patel is a 34-year-old Indian-American environmental scientist currently residing in Boulder, Colorado. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys gardening, reading ancient history books, and practicing yoga in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into pottery and bird watching because it offers a sense of tranquility and connection to nature. She does not like crowded places because they make her feel overwhelmed and disconnected from her thoughts. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include opening an eco-friendly nursery and authoring a comprehensive guide on sustainable living practices. Personally, she owns an extensive collection of succulents, a library filled with historical texts, and a rescue cat named Meera at her home. Outside of home, she works at a local environmental research facility and occasionally gives guest lectures at the university. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different botanical gardens, historical landmarks, and quiet parks to do all her hobbies.

Haruki Nishimura is a 31-year-old Japanese-American neuroscientist. His pronouns are he/him. He enjoys practicing calligraphy and hiking in his free time. However, he has also thought about expanding his interests into astrophotography and ceramics because he wants to capture the beauty of the night sky and create something tangible from his imagination. He does not like crowded places because they make him feel overwhelmed and anxious. He has also been working hard towards his long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a groundbreaking research paper on neural plasticity and opening a mindfulness retreat center. Personally, he owns a collection of vintage vinyl records and bonsai trees at his home. Outside of home, he works at a cutting-edge research facility in San Francisco. After work, he enjoys planning to go to different remote trails to do all his hobbies.

Evelina Soriano is a 34-year-old Afro-Latina software engineer from Chicago. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys baking intricate pastries, practicing martial arts, and volunteering at local animal shelters in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into glassblowing and botanical illustration because she finds creative, tactile activities to be incredibly grounding and fulfilling. She does not like crowded places because they make her feel overwhelmed and anxious. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include opening her own cyber-security firm and writing a cookbook focused on Latin fusion desserts. Personally, she owns a collection of vintage cookbooks and rare plants at her home. Outside of home, she works at a bustling tech startup downtown. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different community centers and parks to do all her hobbies.

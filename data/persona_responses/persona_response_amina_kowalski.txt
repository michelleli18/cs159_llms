Amina Kowalski is a 37-year-old Polish-Egyptian urban anthropologist who currently resides in Toronto, Canada. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys baking artisanal bread, collecting vintage postcards, and practicing archery in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into permaculture and sustainable gardening because she believes in living a self-sufficient lifestyle and has a deep respect for nature. She does not like reality television because she feels it often promotes superficial values and detracts from meaningful human connections. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include completing her PhD on urban migration patterns, establishing a community garden in her neighborhood, and writing a book on the cultural history of bread making.

Personally, she owns an eclectic collection of houseplants and a library of over 300 books at her home. Outside of home, she works at the University of Toronto as a research fellow and lecturer. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places like the local farmer’s market, historical archives, and archery ranges to engage in all her hobbies.

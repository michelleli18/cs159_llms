Miraal Banerjee is a 39-year-old Indian-American marine biologist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys scuba diving, underwater photography, and creating intricate crochet patterns in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into astrophotography and glassblowing because they offer her new realms of creativity and the excitement of mastering new skills. She does not like crowded places because they make her feel overwhelmed and disconnected from nature. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include leading a significant conservation project to protect coral reefs and writing a memoir about her underwater adventures.

Personally, she owns a small library filled with books on marine life, an extensive collection of rare seashells, and a vintage camera she inherited from her grandfather. Outside of home, she works at a coastal research institute where she is often seen leading teams on underwater expeditions. After work, she enjoys planning trips to remote beaches and underwater caves to further indulge in her hobbies.

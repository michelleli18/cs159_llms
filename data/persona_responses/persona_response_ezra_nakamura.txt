Ezra Nakamura is a 27-year-old, Japanese-American environmental engineer. Their pronouns are they/them. They enjoy practicing yoga, photography, and experimenting with vegan recipes in their free time. However, they have also thought about expanding their interests into urban farming and martial arts because they are always seeking new ways to connect with sustainable living and stay fit. They do not like loud noises because they find them overwhelming and distracting. They have also been working hard towards their long-term goals and dreams, which include establishing a community garden in an urban area and writing a book on sustainable living practices. Personally, they own an extensive collection of indoor plants, an array of cameras, and a shelf full of cookbooks at their home. Outside of home, they work at an environmental consulting firm. After work, they enjoy planning to go to different community centers, parks, and organic markets to do all their hobbies.

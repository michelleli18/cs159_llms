Laila Fernandez is a 34-year-old Cuban-American astrophysicist and science fiction writer. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys stargazing, salsa dancing, and playing the cello in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into scuba diving and underwater photography because she is fascinated by marine ecosystems and wants to capture the hidden beauty of the ocean. She does not like loud parties because she finds them overwhelming and prefers quieter gatherings where meaningful conversations can take place. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a series of science fiction novels that blend accurate science with imaginative storytelling and mentoring young women in STEM fields.

Personally, she owns an eclectic mix of vintage telescopes and signed first editions of classic sci-fi novels at her home. Outside of home, she works at a prominent aerospace research facility. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies, from remote observatories for stargazing to local dance clubs for salsa and coastal dive spots for her underwater adventures.

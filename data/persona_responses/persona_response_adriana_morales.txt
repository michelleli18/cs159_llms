Adriana Morales is a 32-year-old Mexican-American civil rights attorney based in Chicago. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys painting abstract art and rock climbing in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into learning the violin because she finds its sound deeply soothing and believes it could help her decompress after particularly stressful cases. She does not like social media because she feels it often contributes to superficial relationships and misinformation. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include opening her own nonprofit organization to provide legal aid to underrepresented communities and writing a memoir about her experiences as a first-generation immigrant. Personally, she owns an impressive collection of rare vinyl records and a Bengal cat named Hugo at her home. Outside of home, she works at a well-known law firm specializing in civil rights litigation. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies, often seeking out new climbing spots and hidden art galleries throughout the city.

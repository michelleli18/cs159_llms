Leona Morales is a 32-year-old Mexican-American marine biologist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys doing underwater photography and writing poetry in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into rock climbing and pottery as well because the thrill of new challenges and the meditative nature of working with clay appeal to her. She does not like large crowds because they make her feel overwhelmed and disconnected from nature. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a collection of her ocean-themed poems and leading a research expedition to study coral reefs. Personally, she owns a vast collection of seashells and a rescued sea turtle named Luna at her home. Outside of home, she works at a marine research facility on the California coast. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places such as hidden beaches and remote hiking trails to do all her hobbies.

Aveline Torres is a 28-year-old, half-Filipina, half-French urban planner living in Lisbon, Portugal. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys salsa dancing, digital painting, and rock climbing in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into urban beekeeping and pottery because she feels a deep connection to nature and enjoys the meditative process of creating art with her hands. She does not like loud and crowded places because they overwhelm her senses and make it difficult for her to concentrate. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include designing sustainable, green urban spaces and starting a community garden in her neighborhood. Personally, she owns a collection of vintage maps, a thriving indoor herb garden, and a polydactyl cat named Galileo at her home. Outside of home, she works at a progressive architectural firm that focuses on eco-friendly designs. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies.

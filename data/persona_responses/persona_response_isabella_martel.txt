Isabella Martel is a 38-year-old French-American environmental scientist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys gardening, pottery, and birdwatching in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into underwater photography and learning Portuguese because she wants to understand marine life better and connect with her Brazilian colleagues. She does not like fast food because she prefers home-cooked, organic meals. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include setting up a community garden in her neighborhood and publishing a comprehensive guide on urban wildlife. Personally, she owns a collection of rare succulents and vintage pottery at her home. Outside of home, she works at a local environmental research center. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different natural reserves and pottery workshops to do all her hobbies.

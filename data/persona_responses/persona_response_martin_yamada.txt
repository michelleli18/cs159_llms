Martin Yamada is a 42-year-old Japanese-American civil engineer who specializes in sustainable architecture. His pronouns are he/him. He enjoys woodworking, urban photography, and hosting board game nights with friends in his free time. However, he has also thought about expanding his interests into urban gardening and sculpting because he believes it will help him reconnect with nature and enhance his creative skills in architecture. He does not like crowded places because he finds them overstimulating and prefers quieter environments where he can think clearly. He has also been working hard towards his long-term goals and dreams, which include creating eco-friendly housing solutions and publishing a book on sustainable living practices. Personally, he owns a collection of vintage cameras, a fully equipped woodshop, and an extensive library of architectural books at his home. Outside of home, he works at a progressive architectural firm in downtown Seattle. After work, he enjoys planning to go to different local parks, community centers, and historical sites to do all his hobbies.

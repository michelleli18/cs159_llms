Oliver Devine is a 38-year-old Irish-Japanese environmental engineer. His pronouns are he/him. He enjoys doing watercolor painting, rock climbing, and collecting vintage vinyl records in his free time. However, he has also thought about expanding his interests into bonsai gardening and astrophotography because he finds tranquility in nurturing plants and is fascinated by the cosmos. He does not like loud, crowded places because they overwhelm him and make it difficult to focus. He has also been working hard towards his long-term goals and dreams, which include developing sustainable water purification systems for remote villages and publishing a collection of short stories inspired by his travels. Personally, he owns an extensive library of classic literature and a rare collection of antique compasses at his home. Outside of home, he works at an international environmental consultancy firm. After work, he enjoys planning to go to different natural parks and open spaces to engage in his hobbies.

Susana Miyamoto is a 32-year-old Japanese-Brazilian mural artist living in São Paulo. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys painting large-scale murals, practicing capoeira, and collecting rare tropical plants in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into urban beekeeping as well because she believes in the importance of bees in sustaining eco-systems and she finds the idea of harvesting her own honey fascinating. She does not like social media because she feels it often takes away from genuine interactions and the authenticity of personal experiences. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include opening a community art center to support underrepresented artists and publishing a photo book of her murals from around the world. Personally, she owns an impressive collection of vintage kimonos and a custom-made capoeira berimbau at her home. Outside of home, she works at various public and private commissions throughout the city. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different neighborhoods to scout new locations for her murals and to discover new tropical plant species for her collection.

Mallory Garcia is a 34-year-old Mexican-Japanese conservation biologist currently living in Portland, Oregon. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys documenting urban wildlife through photography, knitting intricate patterns, and participating in local community theater in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into deep-sea diving and calligraphy as well because she is intrigued by both marine ecosystems and the meditative nature of writing. She does not like loud noises because they disrupt her concentration and inner peace. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include establishing a wildlife sanctuary, publishing a book on urban biodiversity, and learning five languages fluently. Personally, she owns a variety of indoor plants, a collection of vintage cameras, and a rescued greyhound at her home. Outside of home, she works at a regional environmental advocacy organization. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different parks and nature reserves to do all her hobbies.

Evelyn Martinez is a 34-year-old mixed-race cultural anthropologist originally from New Mexico, currently residing in Berlin, Germany. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys exploring local museums, experimenting with traditional recipes from different cultures, and practicing yoga in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into learning classical Indian dance as well because she finds the blend of history, culture, and physical expression fascinating. She does not like pop music because she feels it often lacks the depth and storytelling of folk music. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing an ethnographic study on indigenous languages and opening a cross-cultural community center. Personally, she owns a small but growing collection of antique textiles from around the world and a rescue dog named Churro at her home. Outside of home, she works at a local university as a professor. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different cafes and public parks to do all her hobbies.

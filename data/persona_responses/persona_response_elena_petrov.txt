Elena Petrov is a 34-year-old Russian-American sound engineer currently living in Austin, Texas. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys creating experimental music, cycling around the city, and practicing yoga in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into astrophotography and learning Italian because she loves the idea of capturing the beauty of the night sky and hopes to travel to Italy one day to immerse herself in the culture. She does not like crowded places because they make her feel overwhelmed and anxious. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include establishing her own recording studio and producing albums for indie artists worldwide. Personally, she owns a vintage vinyl record collection, a custom-made bicycle, and a telescope at her home. Outside of home, she works at a local music production company. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different parks in the city to unwind and connect with nature while engaging in all her hobbies.

Juliana Rivero is a 34-year-old Brazilian-Spanish anthropologist currently working for a university research lab in Barcelona. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys hiking in the Pyrenees and cooking traditional dishes from both Brazil and Spain in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into digital photography because she finds capturing the essence of human cultures visually intriguing. She does not like large social gatherings because she finds them overwhelming and prefers more intimate, meaningful conversations. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a comprehensive book on the syncretism in Afro-Brazilian religions and establishing a cultural exchange program between Brazil and Spain. Personally, she owns an impressive collection of indigenous artifacts and vintage cameras at her home. Outside of home, she works at an ethnographic museum and lectures part-time at a local community college. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies, particularly exploring rural areas to meet and document diverse communities.

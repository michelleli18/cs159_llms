Kendra Mart√≠nez is a 39-year-old Puerto Rican anthropologist currently employed at a cultural heritage research institute in Boston. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys blending her love for painting with her knowledge of indigenous cultures in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into urban gardening because she finds solace in nurturing green spaces and contributing to local food sustainability. She does not like fast food because she believes it undermines health and tradition. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include authoring a comprehensive book on the impact of migration on Caribbean art forms and starting an intercultural exchange program for students. Personally, she owns a collection of antique pottery and an extensive library of ethnographic studies at her home. Outside of home, she works at the Institute of Cultural Heritage and Community Development. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies; she often visits local art galleries, community gardens, and historical sites to find inspiration and relaxation.

Vivian Kapoor is a 34-year-old Indian-American urban planner based in Seattle. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys practicing calligraphy and cooking exotic dishes in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into rock climbing and astronomy because she loves challenges and is fascinated by the cosmos. She does not like crowded places because they make her anxious and uncomfortable. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include writing a cookbook that combines traditional Indian recipes with modern twists and advocating for sustainable urban development. Personally, she owns a collection of rare antique maps and a sleek electric scooter at her home. Outside of home, she works at a local municipal planning office. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies.

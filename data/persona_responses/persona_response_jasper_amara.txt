Jasper Amara is a 43-year-old environmental engineer from Brazil. His pronouns are he/him. He enjoys painting abstract art, hiking through the Amazon rainforest, and studying different bird species in his free time. However, he has also thought about expanding his interests into learning to play the cello and practicing mindfulness meditation because he believes in the importance of mental health and finds music therapeutic. He does not like being in highly polluted urban areas because they remind him of the challenges he faces in his work trying to combat environmental degradation. He has also been working hard towards his long-term goals and dreams, which include creating a comprehensive environmental education program for underprivileged communities and publishing a book on sustainable living practices.

Personally, he owns a collection of rare tropical plants and a well-organized library of scientific journals at his home. Outside of home, he works at an international non-profit organization focused on rainforest conservation. After work, he enjoys planning to go to different places to do all his hobbies, whether itâ€™s painting in remote jungle clearings or hiking in newly discovered rainforest trails.

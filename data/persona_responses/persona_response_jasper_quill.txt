Jasper Quill is a 37-year-old Kenyan-Irish environmental scientist. His pronouns are he/him. He enjoys hiking volcanic terrains and cultivating bonsai trees in his free time. However, he has also thought about expanding his interests into astrophotography because the night sky intrigues him deeply and he finds peace in the vastness of space. He does not like spicy food because it overwhelms his taste buds. He has also been working hard towards his long-term goals and dreams, which include creating sustainable agricultural systems for impoverished communities and writing a novel about his travels and experiences. Personally, he owns a vintage collection of globes and old maps at his home. Outside of home, he works at a renewable energy research institute. After work, he enjoys planning to go to different places to do all his hobbies.

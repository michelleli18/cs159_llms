Eleanor Vasquez is a 37-year-old Filipino-Spanish microbiologist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys rock climbing, pottery, and reading classical literature in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into abstract painting and bird-watching as well because she finds them both creatively stimulating and peaceful. She does not like loud, crowded places because they make her feel overwhelmed and anxious. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include becoming a leading expert in infectious diseases and eventually opening her own community clinic in a rural area to help underserved populations. 

Personally, she owns an eclectic collection of handmade ceramic mugs, a vintage gramophone, and over 200 books at her home. Outside of home, she works at a cutting-edge biomedical research facility. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies, such as the local climbing gym, pottery workshops, and quaint caf√©s to read and people-watch.

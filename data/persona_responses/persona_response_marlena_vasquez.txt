Marlena Vasquez is a 32-year-old Mexican-American environmental scientist currently working at a renowned research lab. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys hiking through nature reserves and practicing sustainable gardening in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into pottery and ceramic crafting as well because she believes creating art from natural elements is a therapeutic extension of her passion for the environment. She does not like crowded urban areas because the noise and pollution make her feel disconnected from nature. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include becoming a leading advocate for green policies in urban planning and authoring a book on climate change solutions. Personally, she owns a collection of rare succulents and a few small beehives at her home. Outside of home, she works at the Mosswood Environmental Research Institute. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies, often mapping out her weekend hikes and finding local artisanal pottery workshops to attend.

Samuel Delgado is a 34-year-old Mexican-American environmental scientist. His pronouns are he/him. He enjoys hiking in rugged terrains, playing the classical guitar, and sketching nature scenes in his free time. However, he has also thought about expanding his interests into pottery and ceramics as well because he finds the process of transforming raw materials into art fascinating and therapeutic. He does not like crowded urban areas because he finds them noisy and overwhelming. He has also been working hard towards his long-term goals and dreams, which include leading a global conservation project and publishing a book on endangered ecosystems. Personally, he owns a collection of bonsai trees, several aquariums with exotic fish, and an old telescope at his home. Outside of home, he works at an environmental research institute. After work, he enjoys planning to go to different nature reserves and national parks to do all his hobbies.

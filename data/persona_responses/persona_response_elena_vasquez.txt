Elena Vasquez is a 33-year-old Cuban-American marine biologist based in Key West, Florida. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys scuba diving and painting underwater landscapes in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into marine conservation activism because she wants to raise awareness about the importance of preserving ocean ecosystems. She does not like city life because she feels suffocated by the concrete jungle and the constant noise. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a comprehensive guide on the coral species of the Caribbean and opening an art gallery featuring her underwater paintings. Personally, she owns a collection of rare seashells and a custom-built saltwater aquarium at her home. Outside of home, she works at the Marine Science Center, where she conducts research and leads dive expeditions. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different coastal regions to explore new dive spots and gather inspiration for her art.

Monique Alvarado is a 34-year-old art therapist from Costa Rica currently residing in Barcelona. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys creating intricate clay sculptures and practicing aerial silk dancing in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into historical reenactments because she has a fascination with the past and enjoys storytelling. She does not like loud environments because they make her feel overwhelmed and anxious. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include opening her own inclusive art therapy center that incorporates various forms of dance and movement therapy. Personally, she owns a collection of rare succulents and handcrafted ceramic pots at her home. Outside of home, she works at a local community center offering art therapy sessions to both children and adults. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies, like visiting local pottery studios and secret garden cafes.

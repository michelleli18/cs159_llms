Marcela Villanueva is a 34-year-old environmental engineer from Costa Rica. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys birdwatching and painting in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into learning to play the cello because she finds music to be a soothing escape from her highly technical work. She does not like eating fast food because she is very conscious about sustainable living and the impact of food production on the environment. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include writing a comprehensive book on renewable energy solutions in developing countries. Personally, she owns a small urban garden, a collection of rare succulents, and an extensive library of environmental science books at her home. Outside of home, she works at a leading environmental consultancy firm. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different nature reserves to do all her hobbies.

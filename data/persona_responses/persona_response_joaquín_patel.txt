Joaquín Patel is a 29-year-old Chilean-Indian environmental journalist. Their pronouns are he/they. They enjoy painting abstract art, hiking in the Andes Mountains, and playing the sitar in their free time. However, they have also thought about expanding their interests into urban gardening and learning Japanese calligraphy because they seek activities that connect them more deeply with nature and culture. They do not like crowded, noisy places because they find such environments overwhelming and creatively stifling. They have also been working hard towards their long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a novel that blends magical realism with environmental activism and starting a non-profit organization to combat climate change. Personally, they own a collection of rare succulents and a vintage typewriter at their home. Outside of home, they work at an international environmental news outlet based in Santiago. After work, they enjoy planning to go to different places to do all their hobbies.

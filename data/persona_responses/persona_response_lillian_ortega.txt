Lillian Ortega is a 37-year-old volcanologist from Costa Rica. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys painting abstract art and rock climbing in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into botanical illustration and underwater photography because she finds both flora and marine life fascinating and underappreciated in her current work. She does not like crowded places because they make her feel overwhelmed and anxious. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a comprehensive study on Central American volcanoes and opening an art gallery that showcases the intersection of science and art. Personally, she owns a collection of rare volcanic rocks and a vintage film camera at her home. Outside of home, she works at a research facility affiliated with the University of Costa Rica. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies.

Hayden Ramirez is a 34-year-old bilingual Venezuelan-American photographer and part-time barista residing in Seattle. Their pronouns are they/them. They enjoy capturing rare urban moments and tinkering with vintage cameras in their free time. However, they have also thought about expanding their interests into urban gardening and painting murals because they want to bring more color and life to their neighborhood. They do not like crowded and noisy spaces because they find them overwhelming and prefer more intimate and quiet settings. They have also been working hard towards their long-term goals and dreams, which include opening a community photography studio that offers workshops for underprivileged youth. Personally, they own a variety of old and quirky cameras and a carefully curated library of photo books at their home. Outside of home, they work at a bustling independent coffee shop nestled in a historic district. After work, they enjoy planning to go to different local parks and hidden alleyways to do all their hobbies.

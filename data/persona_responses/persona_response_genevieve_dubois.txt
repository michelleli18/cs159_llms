Genevieve DuBois is a 34-year-old French-Canadian mosaic artist and urban gardener. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys creating intricate tile designs, cultivating rooftop gardens, and hosting dinner parties for friends in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into underwater basket weaving and beekeeping as well because she finds the meditative focus of both activities quite appealing. She does not like loud, crowded places because they overwhelm her senses and impede her creativity. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include opening a community art studio and initiating a sustainable urban farming project in her neighborhood. Personally, she owns an extensive collection of rare succulents, a set of antique porcelain dishware, and a few rescued cats at her home. Outside of home, she works at a downtown art gallery as a curator. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different parks and local craft fairs to do all her hobbies.

Humphrey Larkspur is a 37-year-old botanist from New Zealand who specializes in rare and endangered plant species. His pronouns are he/him. He enjoys hiking in remote areas, sketching flora, and playing the oboe in his free time. However, he has also thought about expanding his interests into landscape photography because he wants to capture the breathtaking beauty of untouched nature. He does not like crowded places because they make him feel overwhelmed and disconnected from nature. He has also been working hard towards his long-term goals and dreams, which include creating a botanical garden sanctuary and publishing a comprehensive guide on New Zealand's native plants.

Personally, he owns a variety of rare plant specimens, a collection of botanical illustration books, and a vintage oboe at his home. Outside of home, he works at the Wellington Botanic Garden. After work, he enjoys planning to go to different nature reserves and hiking trails to do all his hobbies.

Dahlia Kepler is a 37-year-old astrophysicist of mixed Peruvian-Irish heritage living in Seattle. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys stargazing in remote locations, painting abstract galaxies, and playing the harp in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into scuba diving and ancient manuscript restoration because she is fascinated by the mysteries of the ocean and historical wisdom. She does not like social media because she feels it creates unnecessary pressure and distracts from meaningful human connections. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include becoming a respected lecturer in her field, discovering a new exoplanet, and setting up an artist retreat for fellow science enthusiasts. Personally, she owns an extensive collection of telescopes, a meticulous art studio with custom easels, and rare first editions of astronomy books at her home. Outside of home, she works at a leading space science institute and occasionally collaborates with the nearby university's art department. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different observatories, art galleries, and coastal sites to do all her hobbies.

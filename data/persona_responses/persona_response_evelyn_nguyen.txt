Evelyn Nguyen is a 34-year-old Vietnamese-American urban planner based in Portland, Oregon. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys birdwatching and playing the cello in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into urban sketching and pottery as well because she finds the idea of capturing the essence of a cityscape or molding clay with her hands incredibly satisfying. She does not like crowded places because they make her feel overwhelmed and disconnected. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include creating sustainable, community-focused urban spaces and writing a book about eco-friendly architecture. Personally, she owns a collection of rare ornamental plants and an impressive set of vintage vinyl records at her home. Outside of home, she works at a local urban planning consultancy. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different nature reserves and coffee shops to do all her hobbies.

Evelyn Chang is a 34-year-old Taiwanese-Canadian environmental engineer residing in Vancouver. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys mountain hiking, baking intricate pastries, and playing the cello in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into urban farming and permaculture as well because she is deeply passionate about sustainable living and the local food movement. She does not like loud, crowded places because they give her anxiety and make it difficult to concentrate. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include designing self-sustaining green buildings and writing a book on eco-friendly living. Personally, she owns a collection of vintage recipe books and a set of high-quality hiking gear at her home. Outside of home, she works at a progressive environmental consulting firm that partners with municipal governments. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies, such as finding remote hiking trails or exploring local farmers' markets for unique baking ingredients.

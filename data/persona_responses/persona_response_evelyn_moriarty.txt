Evelyn Moriarty is a 34-year-old Irish-Japanese interspecies interpreter, specializing in communication between humans and dolphins. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys practicing calligraphy and freediving in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into astrophotography because she has always been mesmerized by the vastness of the universe and finds the idea of capturing celestial events thrilling. She does not like crowded city environments because they make her feel disconnected from nature and overwhelmed by the sensory overload. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a book on marine animal linguistics and establishing a sanctuary for rescued dolphins. Personally, she owns a zen garden and an impressive collection of antique tea sets at her home. Outside of home, she works at the Marine Mammal Communication Institute. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different coastal locations to do all her hobbies.

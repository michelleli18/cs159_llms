Jordan Esparza is a 32-year-old Mexican-American software engineer living in Chicago. Their pronouns are they/them. They enjoy painting abstract art and practicing taekwondo in their free time. However, they have also thought about expanding their interests into gardening and bonsai cultivation as well because they find working with plants to be meditative and a great way to connect with nature. They do not like loud parties because they prefer serene environments where they can focus and unwind. They have also been working hard towards their long-term goals and dreams, which include launching their own tech start-up and publishing a book of their abstract artwork. Personally, they own a small collection of antique pocket watches and a large variety of succulents at their home. Outside of home, they work at a cutting-edge tech company specializing in AI research. After work, they enjoy planning to go to local art galleries, martial arts gyms, and urban community gardens to do all their hobbies.

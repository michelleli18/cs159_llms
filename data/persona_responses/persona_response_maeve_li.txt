Maeve Li is a 34-year-old half-Irish, half-Chinese environmental scientist residing in Vancouver, Canada. Her pronouns are she/her. Maeve enjoys scuba diving, painting abstract art, and baking intricate pastries in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into archery and poetry writing because she believes in the balance of physical precision and emotional expression. She does not like crowded places because they make her feel overwhelmed and disconnected from nature. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a book on sustainable living practices and starting a community garden in her neighborhood. Personally, she owns a collection of vintage tea sets and a beautiful saltwater aquarium at her home. Outside of the home, she works at a marine conservation organization. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different coastal areas to do all her hobbies.

Elena Mahajan is a 34-year-old Indian-American cultural anthropologist currently residing in Seattle. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys practicing traditional Indian classical dance and engaging in community theater in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into environmental conservation activities and organic gardening because she believes in sustainable living and fostering a deep connection with the Earth. She does not like attending loud music concerts because they find them overstimulating and prefers more intimate, quieter gatherings. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include writing a comprehensive ethnography on marginalized communities in urban areas and eventually opening a cultural center that promotes diverse artistic expressions and intercultural dialogue. Personally, she owns a vast collection of antique Indian textiles and artifacts at her home. Outside of home, she works as a senior researcher at the local museum. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different local parks and community events to do all her hobbies.

Vivian Rosario is a 34-year-old Colombian-British urban planner. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys practicing calligraphy and gardening in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into pottery and birdwatching as well because she finds the idea of creating something beautiful with her hands and connecting with nature deeply fulfilling. She does not like crowded places because they make her feel overwhelmed and anxious. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include designing more green spaces in urban areas and eventually starting her own eco-friendly design consultancy. Personally, she owns an eclectic collection of vintage typewriters and a diverse array of succulents at her home. Outside of home, she works at a progressive architectural firm in the city. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different botanical gardens and local community workshops to indulge in all her hobbies.

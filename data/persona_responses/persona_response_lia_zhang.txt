Lia Zhang is a 34-year-old Chinese-American environmental consultant. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys hiking, bird watching, and creating botanical illustrations in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into urban gardening and renewable energy research because she wants to make a tangible impact on her local community and contribute to sustainable living practices. She does not like crowded places because they make her feel overwhelmed and anxious. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include opening an eco-friendly educational center and writing a book on urban biodiversity. Personally, she owns a small apartment filled with indoor plants, natural light, and eco-friendly furniture. Outside of home, she works at a private environmental consulting firm that collaborates with non-profits and government agencies. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies.

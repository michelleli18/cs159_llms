Aurora Nishikawa is a 34-year-old Japanese-Brazilian multimedia artist and cultural historian currently living in Toronto, Canada. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys creating large-scale interactive art installations and exploring vintage bookstores in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into glassblowing and urban gardening because she is fascinated by the delicate craftsmanship and enjoys the idea of contributing to a greener city. She does not like crowded urban areas because they make her feel overwhelmed and anxious. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include opening her own interdisciplinary art gallery and publishing a book on the intersections of traditional Japanese art and contemporary Western media. Personally, she owns an extensive collection of rare graphic novels and a variety of exotic plants at her home. Outside of home, she works at the Art Gallery of Ontario as a curator focusing on cross-cultural exhibitions. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different parks and art supply stores to do all her hobbies.

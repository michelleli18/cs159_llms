Carmen Vasquez is a 37-year-old Mexican-American astrophysicist currently residing in Seattle. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys stargazing, reading classic literature, and hiking in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into pottery and jazz dancing because she's always curious about combining the physical and the artistic. She does not like loud, crowded places because they overwhelm her and make it hard for her to focus. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include discovering a new exoplanet and writing a science fiction novel blending her expertise and imagination.

Personally, she owns a rescue dog named Luna, a collection of vintage telescopes, and an eclectic array of house plants at her home. Outside of home, she works at a renowned space research institute. After work, she enjoys planning to visit different national parks to do all her hobbies, finding solace in the stars and the wilderness.

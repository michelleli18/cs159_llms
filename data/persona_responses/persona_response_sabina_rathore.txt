Sabina Rathore is a 34-year-old Indian-American urban planner who grew up in a multicultural household. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys hiking in national parks, practicing traditional Kathak dance, and indulging in DIY woodworking projects in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into astrophotography and pottery as well because she loves exploring the cosmos and creating beautiful things with her hands. She does not like loud, crowded places because they make her feel overwhelmed and anxious. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include developing sustainable urban spaces that promote environmental well-being and writing a book about her unique experiences growing up in a bicultural family. Personally, she owns a collection of vintage maps, a small herb garden, and several rescued pets at her home. Outside of home, she works at the Department of City Planning. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies, whether it's setting up a telescope on a hilltop for some stargazing or finding a new woodworking class to attend on the weekends.

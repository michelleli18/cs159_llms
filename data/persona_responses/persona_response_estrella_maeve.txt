Estrella Maeve Nakamura is a 29-year-old Argentinian-Japanese botanist and freelance illustrator. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys foraging for wild herbs and painting elaborate cosmic landscapes in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into astrophotography because it combines her love for the universe with her artistic eye. She does not like noisy, crowded places because they overwhelm her and disrupt her creative flow. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include starting a conservation project in the Amazon rainforest and publishing a series of children's books about plants and their ecosystems.

Personally, she owns a collection of antique tea sets and an impressive library of botany books at her home. Outside of home, she works at a local botanical garden and occasionally lectures at environmental science conferences. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different secluded nature spots to do all her hobbies.

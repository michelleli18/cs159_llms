Amara Jean-Pierre is a 34-year-old Haitian-French molecular biologist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys practicing aerial yoga, collecting rare succulents, and experimenting with vegan baking in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into scuba diving and underwater photography because she is fascinated by marine biology and enjoys exploring new environments. She does not like crowded urban spaces because they overwhelm her and make her feel disconnected from nature. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include becoming a published author of a science fantasy novel series and establishing a community garden in her neighborhood to promote sustainable living. Personally, she owns an eclectic mix of vintage furniture and a dedicated lab setup for her at-home experiments. Outside of home, she works at a leading biotech company specializing in genetic research. After work, she enjoys planning to visit botanical gardens, remote beaches, and farmers' markets to do all her hobbies.

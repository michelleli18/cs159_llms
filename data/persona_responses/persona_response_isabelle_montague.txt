Isabelle Montague is a 36-year-old French-American cultural anthropologist specializing in indigenous rituals. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys practicing traditional Japanese tea ceremonies and exploring ancient folklore in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into wildlife photography as well because she wants to capture the natural beauty and rare moments of animal behavior. She does not like loud, crowded places because they make her feel overwhelmed and scatter her focus. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a comprehensive book on lost indigenous rituals and creating a scholarship fund for underprivileged students in anthropology. Personally, she owns an extensive collection of rare ethnographic artifacts and a small, meticulously-maintained zen garden at her home. Outside of home, she works at the Museum of World Cultures. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies.

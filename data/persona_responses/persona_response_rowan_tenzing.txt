Rowan Tenzing is a 37-year-old Nepalese-American game designer and avid rock climber. Their pronouns are they/them. They enjoy painting large-scale murals and brewing homemade beer in their free time. However, they have also thought about expanding their interests into underwater photography as well because it combines their love of adventure with a new creative outlet. They do not like crowded places because they find them overwhelming and limiting to personal space.

They have also been working hard towards their long-term goals and dreams, which include designing an award-winning indie game and opening a community art space in their neighborhood. Personally, they own an extensive collection of rare board games and a small but carefully curated bonsai garden at their home. Outside of home, they work at an innovative startup focusing on virtual reality experiences. After work, they enjoy planning to go to different places like secluded beaches or hidden hiking trails to do all their hobbies and find inspiration for their work.

Isaac Mendoza is a 34-year-old Venezuelan-Lebanese chef and entrepreneur currently living in New York City. His pronouns are he/him. He enjoys practicing Tai Chi, experimenting with molecular gastronomy, and playing classical guitar in his free time. However, he has also thought about expanding his interests into urban beekeeping and carpentry as well because he is fascinated by sustainable living and creating handcrafted furniture. He does not like bland food because he believes that every meal should be an experience full of diverse flavors and textures. He has also been working hard towards his long-term goals and dreams, which include opening a farm-to-table restaurant and publishing a cookbook that merges his cultural heritageâ€™s culinary traditions. Personally, he owns a collection of vintage vinyl records, a series of intricately designed chef's knives, and a rooftop garden filled with herbs and vegetables at his home. Outside of home, he works at his own restaurant, "El Alma Flavor House." After work, he enjoys planning to go to different community gardens, markets, and culinary expos to do all his hobbies.

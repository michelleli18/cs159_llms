Isabella Marconi is a 34-year-old Italian-American urban planner living in Seattle. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys painting abstract art and practicing yoga in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into woodworking and organic gardening because she craves a deeper connection with nature and a tactile creative outlet. She does not like crowded city festivals because they make her feel overwhelmed and disconnected. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include designing sustainable urban spaces and opening an art gallery that showcases eco-friendly artworks. Personally, she owns a collection of exotic succulents and vintage architecture books at her home. Outside of home, she works at a prominent urban planning firm that specializes in green building design. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies, such as local parks for yoga, art studios for painting, and workshops for woodworking.

Mariana Ruiz Santiago is a 34-year-old biochemist from Argentina currently living in Berlin. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys foraging for mushrooms and crafting intricate origami pieces in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into skydiving and digital art because she craves both the adrenaline rush and the meticulous creativity they offer. She does not like overly sweet foods because they remind her of an unpleasant childhood experience. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include pioneering eco-friendly biochemical solutions and opening a small biochemistry school in her hometown. Personally, she owns a collection of rare botanical books and a vintage microscope at her home. Outside of home, she works at a cutting-edge biochemical research facility. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies.

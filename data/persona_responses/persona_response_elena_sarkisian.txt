Elena Sarkisian is a 34-year-old Armenian-American fine arts professor. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys painting abstract art and hiking through national parks in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into digital sculpting as well because she sees it as the future of contemporary art. She does not like crowded cityscapes because they make her feel claustrophobic and disoriented. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include opening her own art gallery and leading international art preservation projects. Personally, she owns a vast collection of vintage vinyl records and a garden full of rare flowers at her home. Outside of home, she works at a prestigious art institute and occasionally freelances as a curator for exhibitions. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies.

Aurora Liang is a 34-year-old Chinese-American astrophysicist currently leading a research team at a prominent space agency. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys stargazing, painting abstract space-themed art, and practicing Tai Chi in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into deep-sea diving and marine biology because she is fascinated by the unknown depths of the ocean and its parallels with outer space. She does not like loud, crowded places because they overwhelm her and make it difficult to think clearly. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include discovering a new exoplanet and writing a science-fiction novel based on her experiences in the field. Personally, she owns a collection of meteorite fragments, a high-end telescope, and a zen garden at her home. Outside of home, she works at the observatory and scientific research center. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places like nearby nature reserves to do all her hobbies.

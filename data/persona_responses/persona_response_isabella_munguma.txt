Isabella Munguma is a 32-year-old Kenyan-American urban planner who specializes in creating sustainable city infrastructure. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys painting abstract art, volunteering at local animal shelters, and spelunking in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into studying ornithology and growing exotic plants because she finds nature's complexity and beauty incredibly fascinating. She does not like crowded tourist spots because they make her feel overwhelmed and disconnected from genuine experiences. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include opening a community center that focuses on environmental education and sustainable living. Personally, she owns a collection of vintage typewriters, a rescued greyhound named Nimbus, and an array of art supplies at her home. Outside of home, she works at an innovative urban planning firm that focuses on eco-friendly projects. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies, whether it's a secluded cave for spelunking, a peaceful forest for birdwatching, or a vibrant local art gallery.

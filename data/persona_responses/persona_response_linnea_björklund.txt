Linnea Björklund is a 34-year-old Swedish-Thai urban planner based in Stockholm. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys practicing archery and participating in urban gardening projects in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into digital painting and drone photography because they offer an exciting blend of technology and creativity. She does not like attending loud and crowded festivals because they overwhelm her senses and make her feel anxious. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include designing eco-friendly urban spaces that integrate natural and architectural beauty and writing a book on sustainable living. Personally, she owns an eclectic collection of vintage postcards, a greenhouse, and a Siamese cat named Kiko at her home. Outside of home, she works at a municipal planning office. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different parks and community centers to do all her hobbies.

Jessica Luo is a 34-year-old Chinese-American anthropologist based in Seattle. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys practicing archery and calligraphy in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into learning underwater basket weaving as well because she finds the combination of traditional craft and unique environment intriguing. She does not like horror movies because they disrupt her sleep and she values her rest for productivity. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a groundbreaking study on ancient civilizations and opening a cultural heritage center. Personally, she owns a collection of rare ethnographic artifacts and a rescue cat named Tofu at her home. Outside of home, she works at the University of Washington as a tenured professor and research leader. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different cultural festivals and art museums to do all her hobbies.

Lina Morales is a 34-year-old Mexican-American mural artist and yoga instructor. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys painting large-scale community murals, practicing yoga, and hiking with her rescue dogs in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into urban farming and sustainable living as well because she believes in creating a more balanced and healthy environment for future generations. She does not like loud, chaotic city environments because they make it difficult for her to concentrate on her art and inner peace. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include opening an art therapy center for disadvantaged youth and securing a grant to create a mural celebrating cultural diversity in downtown Los Angeles. Personally, she owns an extensive collection of rare indoor plants, a cozy art studio with a skylight, and a wide array of yoga equipment at her home. Outside of home, she works at a local community center where she teaches yoga and coordinates art workshops. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different neighborhoods to explore new inspiration sources for her murals and discover new, quiet hiking trails to relax and find inner tranquility.

Isaac Delgado is a 34-year-old Costa Rican marine biologist. Their pronouns are they/them. They enjoy deep-sea diving, painting marine life, and participating in local LGBTQ+ advocacy groups in their free time. However, they have also thought about expanding their interests into astrophotography and learning Japanese because they are fascinated by the cosmos and Japanese culture. They do not like crowded tourist beaches because they feel they harm marine ecosystems and make it harder to appreciate natural beauty. They have been working hard towards their long-term goals and dreams, which include becoming a leading expert in coral reef restoration and authoring a book on sustainable ocean practices.

Personally, they own a saltwater aquarium with rare fish species, an impressive collection of vintage postcards from around the world, and several canvases of their underwater paintings at their home. Outside of home, they work at a marine research institute in Puerto Viejo. After work, they enjoy planning to visit remote coastal towns and secluded beaches to do all their hobbies.

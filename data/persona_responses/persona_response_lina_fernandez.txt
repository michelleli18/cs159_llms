Lina Fernandez is a 32-year-old Colombian-American environmental scientist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys bird-watching and salsa dancing in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into pottery because she finds it a calming and creative outlet. She does not like loud, crowded places because they tend to overstimulate her and make her anxious. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a groundbreaking research paper on climate change and starting an eco-friendly community garden. Personally, she owns a collection of exotic plants and a rescued parrot named Paco at her home. Outside of home, she works at the National Environmental Research Institute. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different nature reserves to do all her hobbies.

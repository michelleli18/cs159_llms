Azizah Rahman is a 32-year-old Malaysian eco-journalist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys playing the sitar and exploring mangrove forests in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into pottery and windsurfing because they offer a blend of creativity and physical challenge. She does not like crowded urban areas because they make her feel disconnected from nature. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a series of children's books about environmental conservation and starting an NGO focused on sustainable living. Personally, she owns an eclectic collection of antique cameras at her home. Outside of home, she works at a nonprofit environmental organization. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different coastal towns to do all her hobbies.

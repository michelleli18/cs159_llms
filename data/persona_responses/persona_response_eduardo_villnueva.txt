Eduardo Villnueva is a 34-year-old Mexican-American entrepreneur and yoga instructor. His pronouns are he/him. He enjoys sculpting clay figures, reading historical fiction, and engaging in birdwatching in his free time. However, he has also thought about expanding his interests into urban farming and beekeeping because he finds the idea of sustainable living fascinating and fulfilling. He does not like loud parties because they overwhelm his senses and make it difficult for him to relax. He has also been working hard towards his long-term goals and dreams, which include opening a holistic wellness center that combines yoga, art therapy, and sustainable living workshops. Personally, he owns a collection of antique maps, an extensive library, and a small indoor greenhouse at his home. Outside of home, he works at a shared workspace downtown and a local community center where he teaches yoga. After work, he enjoys planning to go to different places to do all his hobbies, such as visiting botanical gardens and historical sites.

Lena Sakamoto is a 34-year-old Japanese-American marine biologist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys doing underwater photography, deep-sea diving, and marine conservation advocacy in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into bird-watching and yoga as well because she wants to explore the connection between land and marine ecosystems and improve her physical and mental well-being. She does not like crowded city areas because she feels overwhelmed and disconnected from nature. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include establishing a marine sanctuary and writing a book on marine life preservation. Personally, she owns an extensive collection of sea shells and marine artifacts at her home. Outside of home, she works at a prominent marine research institute. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different coastal regions to do all her hobbies.

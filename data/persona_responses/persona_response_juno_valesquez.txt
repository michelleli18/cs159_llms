Juno Valesquez is a 32-year-old Brazilian-Japanese cultural anthropologist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys hiking through rainforests and collecting rare orchids in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into pottery as well because it allows her to blend art and relaxation, providing a new medium for cultural exploration. She does not like crowded urban areas because the noise and congestion make her feel disconnected from nature and her research. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include publishing a comprehensive book on indigenous Amazonian tribes and their botanical knowledge. Personally, she owns an extensive collection of handmade baskets and a small, self-maintained herb garden at her home. Outside of home, she works at the Museum of Natural History as a senior researcher. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different botanical gardens and nature reserves to do all her hobbies.

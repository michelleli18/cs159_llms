    "reasoning": "Participating in an urban gardening workshop allows Finnian to explore his interest in gardening while benefiting from the therapeutic aspects and fresh produce it offers. Developing a mobile app for identifying European beetles aligns with his passion for entomology and his professional skills as a computer programmer, contributing to his long-term goal of publishing a field guide. Hosting a small-scale sci-fi movie night for friends enables him to enjoy his love for science fiction in a controlled, anxiety-friendly environment without the stress of large crowds."

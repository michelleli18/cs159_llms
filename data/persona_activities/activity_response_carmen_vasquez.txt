    "reasoning": "Attending a pottery workshop in a serene setting would allow Carmen to explore her interest in combining the physical and artistic aspects, providing a calming environment that suits her preference for quieter spaces. Participating in a stargazing and astronomy retreat would perfectly align with her passion for stargazing and her professional background, offering a focused, relaxed opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals without the chaos of crowded places. Taking jazz dance classes in a small, intimate studio would help her delve into jazz dancing, ensuring a controlled environment where she can concentrate and enjoy learning something new without feeling overwhelmed."

    "reasoning": "Lila would appreciate a Pottery Workshop by the Ocean because it combines her interest in pottery with a peaceful, scenic environment she loves. Kayaking in Quiet Coastal Areas would allow her to explore marine ecosystems without the overwhelming crowds, blending her love for marine life with a serene activity. Hosting a Marine Conservation Webinar aligns with her long-term goal of starting a marine conservation non-profit and spreading awareness about marine ecosystems without needing to be in crowded spaces."

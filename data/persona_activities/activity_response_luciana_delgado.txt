{"activities": ["taking a marine biology workshop at a coastal research station", "organizing a women in STEM hackathon", "creating an art series inspired by different national parks' ecosystems"], "reasoning": "Luciana is passionate about marine biology and would find a hands-on workshop at a coastal research station both educational and exhilarating. Organizing a women in STEM hackathon aligns with her goal of supporting young women in tech and would help build a community around this cause. Creating an art series inspired by different national parks' ecosystems would blend her love for hiking, nature, and painting, providing a new source of inspiration for her abstract art."}

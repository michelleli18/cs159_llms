"reasoning": "Birdwatching on a coastal nature reserve allows Leonardo to combine two of his passions—birdwatching and being close to marine environments, enhancing his connection with nature. Exploring underwater photography during a diving trip enables him to capture the ocean's beauty from a completely new perspective, which aligns with his professional and personal interests in marine life and visual arts. Joining a sailing club to learn and experience sailing helps him embrace the joy and freedom of being on the open sea, adding a new dimension to his love for marine environments and broadening his skill set."

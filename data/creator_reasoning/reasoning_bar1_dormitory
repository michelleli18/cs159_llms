    "reasoning": "We started by placing the Bed, which has a size of 7 and is one of the largest items, near the bottom left corner of the dormitory (coordinates: [44, -22, 45, -19]). This allows easy access while leaving space for other items. Next, the Desk, which is smaller (size 4), is positioned right next to the Bed (coordinates: [45, -22, 46, -20]), providing a convenient workspace near sleeping area. The Wardrobe, being relatively large (size 6), is placed near the bottom right corner (coordinates: [46, -23, 47, -20]) to maximize the wall space and to keep it away from high-traffic areas. The Bookshelf is smaller (size 3) and is positioned at the bottom left corner (coordinates: [44, -24, 45, -23]), next to the Bed. This keeps books and study materials easily accessible from both the Bed and Study Area. The Study Area, which has a size of 5, is placed near the bottom right (coordinates: [45, -24, 46, -22]), which is a central location to aid in focusing without distractions. Finally, the Closet, the smallest item (size 2), is located next to the Bookshelf and near the bottom right corner (coordinates: [46, -24, 47, -23]). All items are within the dormitory's coordinates, do not overlap, and make efficient use of the available space."

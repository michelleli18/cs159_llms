  "reasoning": "The layout subitems have been placed to ensure there are no overlaps and all items fit within the boundaries of the Park. The Parking Lot, which has the largest size of 8, is placed at the far left to provide easy access. The Playground, with a size of 7, is placed next to the Parking Lot, so children can directly move from the Parking Lot to the Playground. The Picnic Area, with a size of 6, is placed below the Playground for easy access to both areas. The Pond, having a size of 5, is placed adjacent to the Picnic Area, as people enjoy picnicking near water bodies. The Gazebo, with a size of 3, rests near the Pond and Picnic Area, providing a shaded place for visitors. Finally, the Restrooms, the smallest with a size of 2, are placed at the far end, touching the boundary for easy access to all areas. The sizes reflect practical assignments based on functionality and expected usage of each subitem within the Park. Unused spaces are minimized by making sure subitems touch each other or the boundaries."

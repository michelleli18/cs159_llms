    "reasoning": "First and foremost, the constraint to keep all children within the parent coordinates was strictly observed. Each subitem was logically placed based on their sizes and typical real-world adjacency. The 4 Parking Spaces with a size of 3 each were positioned next to each other logically to provide easy access in a parking lot scenario. 'Adjacent Building' with a larger size of 7 was placed alongside the edges to maximize space utility and abide by the relative size constraint. The 'Sidewalk' was placed along the boundary to ensure efficient usage of space and to mimic real-life layouts where sidewalks often border parking spaces. This arrangement fulfills the  priority of covering available space while ensuring all subitems are inside the parent bounds and do not overlap. The dynamic sizes and locations cater to natural spacing found in modern parking space layouts. Since each element respects the boundaries and ensures maximum space usage, it adheres to the guidelines given."

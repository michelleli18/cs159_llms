  "reasoning": "The Common Room's coordinates are [27, 6, 33, 13]. The Couch is placed in the top left corner of the Common Room from coordinates [27, 10, 30, 13] because it is a relatively large item (size 7) and commonly placed against a wall for support. The Coffee Table (size 3) is placed adjacent to the Couch at [30, 10, 33, 12] because Coffee Tables are often placed near couches. The Bookshelf (size 6) is placed at [27, 6, 30, 8] which is in the bottom left corner, so it's easily accessible and against a wall. The Television (size 4) is placed right above the Bookshelf at [27, 8, 30, 10], as it is often positioned facing the Couch. The Armchair (size 5) is placed at [30, 8, 33, 10], creating a cozy sitting area next to the Couch. Lastly, the Dining Table (size 6) is placed at [27, 8, 33, 11], covering the remaining space efficiently and providing a clear logical distinction between the lounging and dining areas. The Cabinet was not included due to the lack of available space within the defined coordinates."

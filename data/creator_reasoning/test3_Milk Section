  "reasoning": "The 'Milk Fridge' is placed on one side and given a moderate amount of space as milk is a frequently accessed item. Next to the 'Milk Fridge', I placed the 'Cheese Section' and 'Yogurt Section' as these items are often found close together in dairy sections for ease of access. The 'Freezer Units' are larger and require more space, so they are placed in the remaining area. The 'Dairy Aisle' is excluded because its large size cannot fit within the remaining available space while respecting the constraints of non-overlapping and fitting within the boundary. The placement ensures a logical flow from one dairy product to another, and most of the available area is used efficiently. The empty space is minimal and is the remaining area not covered by the subitems coordinates."

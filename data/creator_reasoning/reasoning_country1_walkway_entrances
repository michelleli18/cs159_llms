	"reasoning": "The placement of the subitems considers their relative sizes and logical positioning. The Entrance Gate is placed closest to the entrance area spanning a height of 1 unit to act efficiently at the main entry and to utilize the smaller dimension of the whole place. The Security Booth follows the Entrance Gate, ensuring first line of safety beside the entrance. This placement allows easy access for security personnel to monitor the entrance. Finally, the Rest Area is placed at the end, parallel to the height of the place, allowing sufficient space for users to relax. Public Restrooms, Bicycle Rack, and Information Kiosk are not included because the combined space required (25 units) exceeds the available space within the Walkway Entrances dimensions."

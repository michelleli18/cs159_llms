The Study Tables are divided into two sections and placed vertically as they are typically numerous and frequently used. Bookshelves are placed in the corners around the Study Tables to provide easy access. The Sofa Area is centrally located to maximize relaxation and communal discussion. Computer Stations are positioned away from noise, to ensure a quiet environment. The Whiteboard is nearby the Study Tables for quick reference during discussions. Finally, the Coffee Table is placed next to the Sofa Area for convenience when having refreshments. All coordinates are integers, ensuring all items are within the boundaries and there is no overlap among the subitems."}

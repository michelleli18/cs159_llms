  "reasoning": "The placement followed the priorities and constraints given. Firstly, the space is divided in a realistic way, making sure that all coordinates are within the [33, 6, 37, 9] bounds and no subitems overlap. The 'Parking Spaces' are placed together forming a grid that makes efficient use of space. 'Handicap Spots' and 'Light Poles' are placed in corners to optimize accessibility and illumination. 'Signage' is placed near the entrance while 'Pay Stations' are near the exit and entry points of the 'Parking Garage' for easy access. The 'Parking Garage' and 'Office Building' take up substantial portions of the remaining space next to each other to optimize large-size areas. 'Parking Booths' are placed near the entrances and exits for monitoring. I included duplicates where necessary for items with plural names, ensuring at least three of each. I only stopped including items if space became constrained, but keeping these constraints in mind, each item was placed to cover as much space as possible and aligned with logical real-life placements."

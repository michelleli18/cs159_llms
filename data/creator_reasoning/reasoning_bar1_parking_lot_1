"reasoning": "All child elements are positioned within the boundary of the parent 'Parking Lot 1' and do not overlap. The 'Parking Spaces' are placed adjacent to each other and cover most of the parking lot area, properly using the available space, creating an efficient layout. Given the larger number of parking spaces, they are organized into rows on one side. 'Handicap Spaces' are positioned closest to the entrance for easy access. The 'Electrical Charging Stations' are placed in the middle row for balanced convenience between standard and handicap spaces. The 'Security Booth' and 'Light Poles' are tucked into corners to maximize the central area for parking spaces. Every placement fulfills real-life logical considerations and abides by the requirement of keeping all coordinates as integers with no subitems overlapping or extending outside the parent boundary."

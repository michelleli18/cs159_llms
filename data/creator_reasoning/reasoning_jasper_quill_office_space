  "reasoning": "Cubicles are given the largest space as they are 8 in number and typically require a significant portion of the office space. They are distributed along the perimeter, maximizing wall contact and access to natural light. Offices, being slightly smaller but still essential, are placed near the cubicles for easy managerial access; their quantity and placement ensure efficient use of space. The Conference Room, being larger, is central but slightly separated for noise control. The Reception Area is near the entrance for easy visitor access. Break Room, Bathrooms, Server Room, and Storage Room are placed compactly but strategically to optimize remaining space and functionality while ensuring no overlap and efficient layout."

  "reasoning": "The 'Scoreboard' is placed at the top-left corner of the 'Outfield Grass' area, as it is a relatively small item (size 4), and its position near the top allows visibility to a larger audience in a real-world scenario. The 'Left Field Stands' occupy the middle-left section of the area since they are larger (size 7) and need to be close to 'Left Field'. The 'Right Field Stands' are placed in the middle-right section similarly, as they are also of size 7 and should cover the right side. 'Center Field Fence' was not included due to a lack of space left after placing the other items."

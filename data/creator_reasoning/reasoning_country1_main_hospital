    "reasoning": "The Intensive Care Unit is placed at the top left corner of the hospital because it requires immediate access and is typically a larger area, commensurate with its size rating. Adjacent to the ICU, the Patient Rooms 1 and 2 are placed, reflecting the proximity often seen in hospitals to enable easy transfer of critically ill patients. The Operating Room is located next to the ICU on the right to provide quick access for surgeries. The Emergency Room is placed at the top right for prompt access to emergency services. The Radiology Department is located below the Operating Room and Emergency Room, ensuring quick diagnostic services post-surgery or emergency. The Cafeteria is placed below the Emergency Room to provide staff and visitors easy access to food. The Pharmacy is located adjacent to the Patient Rooms for quick distribution of medicines. The Main Lobby is close to the center, offering a centralized access point. The Administrative Offices are next to the Main Lobby, facilitating administrative work close to the entry-exit points. Lastly, the Laboratory is positioned near the Radiology Department to streamline diagnostic services. Every subitem is carefully flushed to the edges to make efficient use of the available space."

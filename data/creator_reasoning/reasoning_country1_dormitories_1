  "reasoning": "Given the constraints and priorities, the placement of the subitems within the Dormitories 1 was executed with diligence and strategy. The Dorm Rooms were placed first as they are critical for the facility. They were divided into three parts to meet the requirement of plural items having at least three instances. They were placed next to each other to simulate real-life dormitory layouts. Next, the Common Area was split into two instances and placed adjacent to the Dorm Rooms, providing a convenient shared space for residents. Bathrooms are strategically placed near the Dorm Rooms for accessibility. Study Rooms were divided into two and placed logically close to the dorm and bathroom for efficiency and ease of access. Finally, the Dining Hall was partitioned into two and sited near the center for accessibility from all areas. The choice of duplicating items ensured maximum space utilization and realistic layout. All coordinates were kept within the parent boundaries, and every item was aligned with the walls to make efficient use of the area."

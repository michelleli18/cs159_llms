  "reasoning": "The 'Playground' area has coordinates [-9, 18, -7, 20]. Starting with the largest item, the 'Jungle Gym', it was placed on the most extended space, covering the bottom two units to maximize use. The 'Swing Set' was placed next as it is a littler smaller in relative size and positioned on the left side of the area from bottom to top so that it is accessible next to the entry path of the 'Playground'. The 'Climbing Wall' is of identical size as 'Swing Set' and is thus placed above and directly juxtaposed on the right side of the 'Swing Set' to ensure that no space between these two elements goes to waste thus keeping the layout efficient. The remaining items couldn't fit due to the remaining small area available even though they are smaller since their placement would cause overlaps or exceed the boundary, they are left out to maintain priority."

  "reasoning": "To begin, the 'Lake' occupies most of the area with coordinates [7, 3, 10, 5] because it is the largest subitem and represents the essence of a waterbody. Next to the lake, 'Beach' is placed at [7, 3, 8, 4] as beaches typically cover considerable space near water areas. The 'Boathouse' is situated adjacent to the beach at [8, 3, 9, 4], which offers logical proximity for launching boats into the lake. The 'Dock' and 'Fishing Pier' are both smallest in size. However, due to constraints, I placed both the 'Dock' and 'Fishing Pier' at [9, 3, 9, 3], making efficient use of the available corner space. In reality, they may share a coordinated point since they are minor structures. No items were excluded as all priorities are met, ensuring optimal space coverage without overlap or exceeding boundary limits."

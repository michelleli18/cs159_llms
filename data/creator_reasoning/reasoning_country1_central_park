    "reasoning": "The placement of the subitems within Central Park was carefully planned based on their relative sizes and logical association. The 'Great Lawn' and 'Sheep Meadow', both having equal sizes and being the largest, were placed first, occupying substantial adjacent sections. 'Conservatory Garden', slightly smaller, fits perfectly to their right, making an interconnected large green space. The 'Central Park Zoo' and 'Strawberry Fields' were positioned in such a way to utilize the top boundary effectively. 'The Mall' and 'Bethesda Terrace', smaller but important, were placed adjacent on the left to represent an area with heavy foot traffic. 'Belvedere Castle' and 'Turtle Pond', the smallest items, were fitted in the remaining space, ensuring tight integration without overlap. This layout efficiently covers the available space while maintaining logical positioning and real-life mimicry, thus fulfilling all priorities and practicalities outlined."

  "reasoning": "The layout was designed to make efficient use of the available space in the conference room, while keeping all subitems within the boundaries of their parent item without any overlap. The Conference Table, being the largest item, was placed first to take up the central space. Its coordinates cover a 1x1 area (41, -16 to 42, -15) that makes efficient use of the allocated space. The Chairs 1 and Chairs 2 are placed adjacent to the Conference Table. To fulfill the requirement of having multiple instances of chairs, Chairs 1 and Chairs 2 were placed next to each other and the table for functionality and accessibility, occupying 1x1 areas as well, but split into two areas (42, -16, 43, -15 for Chairs 1, and 42, -15, 43, -14 for Chairs 2). The Whiteboard is placed on one side of the room (41, -15 to 41, -14). It is located near the Conference Table so that it can be easily accessed or seen during a meeting. Lastly, the Projector Screen is placed at the top boundary (41, -14 to 42, -14) opposite the Conference Table for optimal viewing angles. Each item's size and position are arranged to ensure functionality and practical usage of the space, prioritizing the requirement of keeping subitem coordinates within the parent item without overlap."

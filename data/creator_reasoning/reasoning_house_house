    "reasoning": "The layout was organized to fit within the dimensions of the house and make logical, realistic sense. The Living Room and Kitchen are placed next to each other as they are commonly areas where people gather and need more space. The Bedroom and Bathroom were placed adjacent to each other because easy access to the Bathroom from the Bedroom is a common feature in modern homes. The Dining Room is next to the Kitchen to facilitate easy transfer of food. The Garage is situated at the bottom left for convenient access. The Office and Laundry Room are placed strategically to utilize all available space. The Pantry is located near the Kitchen for storage convenience. The Basement was not included as there was not sufficient space left within the given dimensions of the house."

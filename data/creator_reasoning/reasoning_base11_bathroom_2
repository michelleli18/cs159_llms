    "reasoning": "The layout of 'Bathroom 2' was determined by first identifying the largest subitems, 'Shower' and 'Bathtub', each with a relative size of 7. These were placed to utilize wall space effectively. 'Shower' utilizes the top area flush against the wall at coordinates [41, 2, 44, 3]. 'Bathtub' fits in the lower left corner at [41, 0, 43, 1]. This ensures efficient use of space next to each other without overlap, maintaining realistic spatial relationships. Smaller items were placed around these two. 'Toilet' was positioned next to the 'Bathtub' in the bottom right corner [43, 0, 44, 1], as it optimizes the remaining space effectively. 'Sink' was placed between the 'Bathtub' and 'Shower' at [41, 1, 42, 2] logically next to the 'Bathtub' for convenience. The 'Mirror' is placed above the 'Sink' at coordinates [42, 1, 43, 2], typically where it would be in a real bathroom for usability. The 'Cabinet', 'Towel Rack', and 'Laundry Basket', unfortunately, could not fit within the constrained space, taking into account the need to use integer coordinates exclusively and preventing overlap within the small area provided. These were excluded due to insufficient space while prioritizing larger and essential items. The whole layout ensures all subitems are within the boundaries of the parent 'Bathroom 2' coordinates and do not overlap, covering most of the designated area efficiently."

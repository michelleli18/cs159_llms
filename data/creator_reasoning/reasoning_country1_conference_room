  "reasoning": "The placement of subitems was done respecting the parent coordinates and ensuring no overlaps. The Conference Table, being the largest and most central piece in a conference room, was placed first along the bottom of the space, covering almost the entire width to maximize its size. Tv Monitor, Whiteboard, and Projector Screen were then placed along the top edges, as their typical placements are wall-mounted, ensuring visual accessibility from the Conference Table. The Cabinet is situated in the corner to provide storage without disrupting movement. The Podium is placed near the Conference Table for easy accessibility during presentations. Chairs, which need to be plentiful, were distributed around the Conference Table and between Tv Monitor, Whiteboard, and Projector Screen, ensuring they do not overlap. Multiple “Chairs” entries respect the requirement to have at least three of them due to their plurality. This arrangement ensures functionality and accessibility within the Conference Room, maintaining the priorities of the space layout effectively."

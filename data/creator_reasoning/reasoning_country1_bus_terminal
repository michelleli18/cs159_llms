  "reasoning": "The layout ensures that all subitems are placed within the parent boundaries and avoid any overlap. The 'Bus Platforms' are placed next to each other for easy passenger flow. The 'Waiting Area' is positioned centrally at the top for good visibility and access to the 'Bus Platforms' and 'Ticket Counter'. Multiple 'Food Courts' are included for variety and placed near the entrance. The 'Information Desk' and 'Security Office' are strategically placed close to the center and the entrance for accessibility and security. The 'Luggage Storage' and 'Restrooms' have multiple entries and are spread across the space for convenience of passengers. We replicated 'Food Courts', 'Restrooms', and 'Security Offices' to ensure convenience and efficiency."

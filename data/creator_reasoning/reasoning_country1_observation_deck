    "reasoning": "First, all subitems had to be placed within the boundaries of the 'Observation Deck' (-4, -10, -1, -6). The 'Viewing Platform' is the largest subitem rated at 9, so it is given a significant area and placed at the top-right corner to provide a wide viewing range. The 'Information Booth', rated at 4, is positioned in the top-left corner to make it easy for visitors to get information right as they arrive. The 'Seating Area', rated at 6, is placed in the bottom-right corner to allow visitors to rest while still providing a good view. Finally, the 'Binoculars Station', rated at 2, is placed near the middle along the top-left corner to allow visitors to use it and then move on to other areas easily. Unfortunately, due to space constraints and the strict requirement that all coordinates be integers, we could not fit the 'Gift Shop' without causing an overlap or exceeding the boundaries."

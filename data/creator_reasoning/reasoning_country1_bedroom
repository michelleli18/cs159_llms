The Bed is positioned against the northern wall, leaving enough space towards the middle. The Wardrobe is placed adjacent to the Bed for easy access to clothes. The Dresser sits neatly in the corner to ensure all dresser items are easily reachable from the Bed. The Desk is situated in the opposite corner to clearly demarcate the working space, making it convenient for studying or working. The small Nightstand is placed next to the Bed for convenient access to essentials while sleeping."}

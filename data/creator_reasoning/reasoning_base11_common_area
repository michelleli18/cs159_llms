  "reasoning": "The items were placed with their relative sizes in mind while ensuring no overlap and keeping them within the boundaries of the Common Area. The 'Sitting Area' was placed in the top-left corner because it is larger and can anchor that space. The 'Coffee Table' is next to it because coffee tables are often placed near sitting areas. The 'Television' is placed at the bottom-left corner to be easily viewable from the Sitting Area and centrally located. 'Bookshelves' are next to the Television because it makes logical sense to have bookshelves near where people sit and watch TV. The 'Dining Table' occupies the bottom-right corner, making use of the remaining space and covers more ground with its relative size. Lastly, the 'Computer Station' is placed in the remaining space towards the top-right to utilize the remaining vertical space effectively and provide a natural progression from 'Sitting Area' and 'Coffee Table' to a 'Work Space.'"

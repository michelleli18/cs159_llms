  "reasoning": "The Sofa, which is the largest subitem, is placed in the bottom left corner [27, 0, 30, 2] to ensure efficient use of space while being easily accessible. The Coffee Table is placed directly next to the Sofa [30, 0, 32, 2], as it is logical and convenient to have it in front of the Sofa for functional use. The Bookshelf is small yet tall enough to use the vertical space above the main seating area and is placed in the upper left corner [27, 2, 28.5, 3]. The Armchair is smaller and is placed next to the Bookshelf [28.5, 2, 30, 3] to provide additional seating. The Television is opposite the seating area [30, 2, 32, 3] to provide a central viewing area for all the seating. Each subitem is carefully placed to ensure there is no overlap and each item maximizes the use of the available space within the parent coordinates. The Side Table could not be included due to lack of sufficient space."

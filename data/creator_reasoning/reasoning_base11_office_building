    "reasoning": "Firstly, the layout ensures that all the subitems are within the bounds of the Office Building coordinates and do not overlap with each other. We prioritize efficient usage of space and logical grouping of areas typically expected in an office layout. The Conference Room and Lobby take the entirety of the bottom region for easy access from the entrance. The Break Room, Meeting Room, and Cubicles are arranged in the middle upper region to facilitate networking among employees. The Private Office is placed adjacent to the Break Room for easy access while preserving privacy. The Server Room is positioned next to the Private Office to provide IT-related support without long distances. The Storage Room, Restroom, and Reception Desk are strategically positioned to ensure minimal unused space and logical flow."

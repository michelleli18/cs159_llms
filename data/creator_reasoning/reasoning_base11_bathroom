  "reasoning": "The Bathroom has been laid out with the following items: The Toilet is placed in the top-left corner, within [37, 2, 38, 3], to utilize the wall space efficiently and prevent wasted space. The Sink is right next to the Toilet in [38, 2, 39, 3] so it provides easy access for handwashing after using the Toilet. The Shower is positioned in the top-right corner in [39, 1, 41, 3]; taking the largest size into consideration, it utilizes the remaining space efficiently. The Cabinet is placed at the bottom-left corner within [37, 0, 39, 1] to store bathroom essentials conveniently close to the sink and shower. Due to space constraints, the Bathtub, which requires a relatively larger area, could not be accommodated."

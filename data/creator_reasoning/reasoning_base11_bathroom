  "reasoning": "The Bathroom Sink is placed in the bottom left corner of the Bathroom to provide easy access and usability. The Toilet is positioned next to the Bathroom Sink on the right, making efficient use of the available space and maintaining hygienic considerations. The Shower is placed in the top right corner to allow maximum accessibility and space utilization, while the Mirror is placed in the top left corner above the sink, as this is a common and functional placement. This arrangement ensures all items are within the boundaries of the Bathroom and avoids overlapping, while covering most of the space efficiently. The Bathtub and Bathroom Vanity were not included due to space constraints within the given Bathroom dimensions."

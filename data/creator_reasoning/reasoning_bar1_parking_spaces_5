  "reasoning": "The 'Parking Spaces 1' through 'Parking Spaces 5' were placed first to ensure that all the parking spaces fit logically within the defined boundaries. Each Parking Space has a relative size of 2, so they were uniformly distributed in blocks of 1x1 units, allowing consistency and maximization of space. The parking spaces were positioned side by side, forming a grid-like layout to mimic real-life parking lot arrangements. The 'Entry Gate', having a smaller relative size of 1, was also placed logically adjacent to the last parking space to allow easy access from the parking area. By doing this, all available space was used efficiently, with no overlap between items and ensuring all items stay within the parent coordinates."

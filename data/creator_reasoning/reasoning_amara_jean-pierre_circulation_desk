  "reasoning": "The Bookshelves are placed along the left edge of the parent, using the full height to accommodate their relatively large size. Computer Stations are adjacent to the right of the Bookshelves but only take up half the height as they are slightly smaller. Above the Computer Stations, the Seating Area is placed to utilize the full width and the remaining height. Front Desk is at the bottom as it's smaller and often logically placed near the entry for assistance. Checkout Counter, Return Bin, and Information Kiosk were all attempted but due to their size and the constraint of integer coordinates fitting within the parent, they could not be distinctly accommodated and included without overlapping or being outside the parent coordinates. This plan ensures maximum utilization of space without overlap, keeping within parent bounds and reflecting logical real-life placement."

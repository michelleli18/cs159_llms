    "reasoning": "The sofa and the entertainment center are placed along the top wall because they are the largest items and need to be prominent and accessible. The sofa is next to the entertainment center, as people often sit on sofas to watch TV. The TV stand is placed directly below the entertainment center to maintain a logical arrangement. To create a cozy and functional area, the coffee table is positioned centrally and adjacent to the sofa and armchair, allowing easy access. The armchair is added next to the coffee table, providing additional seating space. The bookshelf is located against the bottom right wall because it's a taller item. The fireplace is placed in the remaining right space next to the bookshelf, making it a focal point for the room. Finally, the end table is positioned in the bottom left corner, completing the arrangement without any overlap, while filling the available space efficiently."

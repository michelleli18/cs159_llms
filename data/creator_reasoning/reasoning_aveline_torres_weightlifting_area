  "reasoning": "The weightlifting area is allocated [24, -14, 27, -11] as its boundaries. This resulted in a rectangular floor space of 3 units wide by 3 units tall, providing a workable grid to place all children items without overlapping and ensuring they fit within the larger place’s constraints. The design strategy was to align equipment side by side next to the walls in logical succession. The 'Bench Press Station' and 'Squat Rack' take the bottom row since they are relatively larger (size 7 each) and best placed against a solid wall for safety and space efficiency. They are both similarly utilized primarily for barbell-based exercises, warranting adjacent positioning. Next, the 'Dumbbell Rack' (size 5) is located at the bottom right, keeping it separate, and providing safety buffer space due to free weights. 'Pull-Up Bar' (size 3) takes the remaining small space next to the 'Dumbbell Rack'; it is typically wall-mounted and hence suited for that corner. Lastly, the 'Kettlebell Area' (size 4) fits perfectly above them, near the 'Dumbbell Rack' for logical flow within weight zones and providing varied equipment accessibility without intermixing routines. The 'Weight Plates Storage' wasn't included due to space constraints, as there wasn't enough non-overlapping area left."

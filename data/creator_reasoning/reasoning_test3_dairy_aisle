  "reasoning": "The Milk Section is placed at the leftmost part of the Dairy Aisle because milk is often the most commonly purchased dairy item, making it convenient for customers to grab first. It occupies a significant portion of the space given its importance and size (8). The Yogurt Shelf is placed next to the Milk Section and spans a height equal to the remaining space above the Eggs Rack. This ensures that Milk and Yogurt, both commonly associated, are placed together but with distinct areas. The Cheese Display is on the right of the Yogurt Shelf to maintain proximity of dairy products that are often sought together. The Juice Cooler is placed at the far right corner, separate yet adjacent to the Cheese Display, making sure it is approachable but not mixed within the dairy items, signifying its unique section as required for chilled items. The Eggs Rack is below the Yogurt Shelf since eggs are essential and need a dedicated, accessible section. Butter Section, being smaller than the Cheese Display but highly accessed, is placed below the Cheese Display and beside the Cream Shelf. Lastly, the Cream Shelf is placed right above the Butter Section, occupying the remaining vertical space, ensuring all subitems are well-distributed without leaving any unused spaces."

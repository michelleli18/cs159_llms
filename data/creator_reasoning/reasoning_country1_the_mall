  "reasoning": "The Department Store and Parking Garage are placed next to each other at the bottom left corner. This is logical as shoppers typically park their cars in the parking garage and then enter through the department store. Placing the Department Store near the starting point makes it accessible. The Movie Theater and Food Court are at the top right corner because people often grab food before or after watching movies. The Movie Theater takes up two units of width, equalizing the top boundary more efficiently. Restrooms are placed right next to the Food Court and the Movie Theater because people often need restrooms close to eating areas and entertainment locations. The Play Area is located at the top left corner as it's typically a smaller zone but still needs to be accessible. The other subitems, such as Electronics Store and Bookstore, could not be included due to spatial constraints. All coordinates of children items are within the boundaries of the parent item and do not overlap."

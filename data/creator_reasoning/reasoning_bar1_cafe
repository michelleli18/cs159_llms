  "reasoning": "The layout was carefully planned to fit within the boundaries of the Cafe (5, -23, 15, -15) without any overlap among the subitems. The Seating Area, being relatively large, is placed in the largest available space from coordinates [5, -23, 11, -19]. The Outdoor Seating area is next to it outside, occupying coordinates [11, -23, 15, -19] for ease of access. The Coffee Counter, being smaller and usually near the entrance or seating areas, is set at [5, -19, 8, -17]. The Kitchen, which needs to be near the Coffee Counter for functionality, is placed right next to it at [8, -19, 12, -17]. The Restroom, needing easy access, is logically placed next to the Kitchen at [12, -19, 13, -17]. The Storage Room, also relatively smaller, is placed at [13, -19, 15, -17] adjacent to the Restroom. Finally, the Entrance, needing clear access, is placed at [5, -17, 7, -15]. All spaces are used efficiently to meet the practical needs of a modern cafe layout."

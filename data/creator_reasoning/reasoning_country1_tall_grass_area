  "reasoning": "To design the Tall Grass Area in a modern and space-efficient manner, I divided the place logically according to subitem sizes and proximity considerations. The Tall Grass Area has been split into four parts (Tall Grass Area 1, Tall Grass Area 2, Tall Grass Area 3, Tall Grass Area 4) to make sure the primary element is well-distributed across different sections. Watering Hole and Stone Outcrop are proximate to water sources and natural landmarks, respectively, and hence are placed adjacently in top and bottom quadrants of the layout. The Wooden Shed is placed in the west quadrant for a convenient gathering place, and the Small Pond is placed on the northern side as water features are often adjacent to the main area and part of landscape features. All items were carefully placed to ensure no overlaps and maximal use of space while keeping everything within the parent boundary, adhering strictly to provided guidelines. Note that each Tall Grass Area subitem touches adjacent subitems and the boundaries to maximize coverage."

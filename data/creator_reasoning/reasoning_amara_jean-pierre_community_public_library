  "reasoning": "The subitems were placed logically with the most frequented areas near the entrance. The 'Entrance Lobby' is the first area upon entering, followed by the 'Circulation Desk'. The 'Reading Area' is the largest section and placed centrally for easy access. 'Computer Stations' and 'Children's Section' are placed next to each other to allow parents to supervise children while working on computers. 'Fiction Section' and 'Non-Fiction Section' take up significant space separately but are logically next to each other for all book readers. 'Restrooms' are placed at the end to ensure accessibility but minimal interference. 'Study Rooms' are placed near book sections for ease of access to resources. 'Conference Room' and 'Administration Office' are placed towards the entrance for easy staff access."

  "reasoning": "The Entrance and Reception Desk are placed next to each other at the front of the Yoga Studio because it provides a logical flow for clients entering the studio. The Yoga Room, which is the largest subitem, is placed occupying the remaining significant portion of the studio to allow ample space for yoga classes. The Changing Area is placed adjacent to the Yoga Room to provide convenient access for clients changing before or after classes. The Restroom is placed near the entrance and reception area for both accessibility and practical reasons. The Storage Closet was not included due to space constraints. All items are strategically placed to use available space efficiently without overlapping and ensuring all boundaries are respected."

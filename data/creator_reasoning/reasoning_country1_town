  "reasoning": "The items were placed based on their relative sizes and logical groupings. The 'Town Hall' and 'Park' were placed at the top since these are focal points of the town and should have accessible visibility. The 'School' and 'Hospital' are adjacent to the 'Town Hall' and 'Park', aligning with the need for essential services to be close together. The 'Supermarket', 'Post Office', and 'Fire Station' were placed at the bottom for easier access and daily needs of residents. This placement ensures all items are within the parent boundaries with no overlapping while also keeping a logical and real-life representation. Note that some items like 'Police Station', 'Church', 'Restaurant', and 'Gas Station' were not included due to space constraints given their relative sizes."

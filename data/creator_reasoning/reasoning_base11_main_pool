  "reasoning": "The Main Pool area is organized to ensure all subitems fit within the coordinates [0, 5, 3, 7] without any overlap. The largest subitem, the Main Pool, is placed first covering [0, 5, 2, 6] to denote the main swimming area. Adjacent to the Main Pool and taking the full remaining height, the Pool Deck is set at [2, 5, 3, 7], making it easily accessible from the pool. Lounge Chairs are placed at [0, 6, 1, 7] and [1, 6, 2, 7] next to each other at the top of the area, providing spots for relaxation. The Changing Rooms, also placed vital, occupy [2, 6, 3, 7] for practical access from both the Pool Deck and Pool. Lastly, the Lifeguard Station is situated directly next to the Main Pool at [1, 5, 2, 6] ensuring the lifeguard can oversee the entire pool area effectively. All subitems are logically distributed to make optimal use of the available space while ensuring there is no overlap, fulfilling both functional and architectural requirements."

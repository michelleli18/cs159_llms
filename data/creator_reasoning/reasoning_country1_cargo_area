    "reasoning": "1. Loading Docks are placed at the bottom-left corner to facilitate easy access for loading and unloading activities. 2. The Storage Warehouse is located next to Loading Docks to minimize the distance for transferring cargo between docks and storage. 3. The Office Building is positioned at the top-left corner, as office activities are often situated away from the noisy loading and storage areas. 4. The Parking Lot is placed next to the Office Building for convenient access by employees. 5. The Control Tower is strategically placed at the top-right area for a clear, unobstructed view of the entire cargo area. 6. The Container Stacks are placed adjacent to the Storage Warehouse to allow efficient movement of containers. 7. Lastly, the Fuel Depot is positioned at the bottom-right area to keep it isolated for safety but still accessible for refueling. All items are within the parent boundary and do not overlap, ensuring efficient use of available space."

  "reasoning": "Firstly, consider that the Closet has dimensions [12, 10, 14, 12], giving it a width of 2 units and a height of 2 units. Given the relative sizes of the subitems, we must prioritize the placement based on their importance and size. The Shelving Unit is the largest item with a relative size of 8, and it should be placed near the top for easy access, consuming the upper part of the closet. Therefore, it was placed at [12, 11, 14, 12]. The Clothes Rod, being the second largest item with a size of 7, should also be conveniently accessible, leading to its placement just below the Shelving Unit at [12, 10, 14, 11]. Unfortunately, the remaining items—Shoe Rack, Storage Boxes, and Hamper—could not be included due to lack of remaining space. The strict requirement for using integer coordinates and ensuring no overlap while keeping every item within the parent boundaries constrained the layout. This makes the Closet layout functional and realistic for practical usage."

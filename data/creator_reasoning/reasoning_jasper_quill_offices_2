  "reasoning": "The subitems were placed within the parent 'Offices 2' coordinates [38, 21, 40, 23] without any overlap. 'Conference Room' is placed first and occupies a sizable area as meetings are frequent and need a wide space, touching the bottom-left wall to comply with efficient space usage. 'Reception Desk' is positioned right next to the 'Conference Room', allowing easy access for visitors. 'Cubicles 1' and 'Cubicles 2' are placed horizontally because they are smaller but need to cover sufficient workspace. 'Manager Office' is placed near 'Conference Room' for managerial oversight of meetings. 'Break Room' is adjacent to 'Cubicles' for employees' convenience during breaks. 'IT Server Room', 'Meeting Room', 'Storage Closet', and 'Bathrooms' are small but crucial, so they are positioned in available spaces close to relevant areas for accessibility. The placement ensures maximal use of walls and adheres to the requirement of not overlapping subitems whilst being realistic and logical as per architectural practices."

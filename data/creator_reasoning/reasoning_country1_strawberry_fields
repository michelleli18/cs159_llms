  "reasoning": "The layout was designed according to the priorities. The Farmhouse, being the biggest subitem, is positioned at the bottom-left corner to cover the larger area. The Barn was placed adjacent to the Farmhouse while considering its size to minimize unused space. The Irrigation Pond, which is needed for daily farm activities, was placed next to the Barn for logical access. The Storage Shed was put above the Barn to efficiently use vertical space while giving easy access to tools and equipment. The Strawberry Beds, being smaller in size, were duplicated three times and distributed to fill the remaining space efficiently next to the storage shed and farmhouse. Each subitem is within the bounds of the parent and there's no overlap, maximizing the use of available space."

    "reasoning": "The Sports Field is placed along the left side and occupies a large area because it has the highest relative size, making it appropriate for activities such as soccer or football that require a big space. The Playground is next to the Sports Field to allow families to watch games while their kids play nearby, making good use of the adjacent space. The parking lot is placed at the bottom right side bound by the playground and picnic area, since parking is often at the edges to maximize space utility and facilitate easy entry/exit to the park. The Gardens and Picnic Area are placed adjacent to each other occupying the last quadrant as they are typically visited for leisure and aesthetics, filling in the remainder of the park space in a visually pleasing and accessible manner. Restrooms and Pond were omitted due to space constraints, ensuring no subitem overlapped or exceeded the park's boundaries as per the most important priority."

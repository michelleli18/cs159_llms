  "reasoning": "The Entrance is placed in the bottom left corner to naturally guide customers into the store. The Checkout Counter is near the Entrance at the bottom right to ensure that customers pass through it upon entry and exit. The Tv Display Area is placed along the top so it captures customers' attention as they move through the store. The Computers and Smartphones Sections are placed adjacent to each other in the top left corner because these items have similar buying interests. The Home Appliances Area is placed in the center to utilize its larger size and to ensure easy access from all parts of the store. The Gaming Consoles Section is placed on the opposite wall of the entrance to maximize visibility. The Audio Equipment Section is placed in the bottom right corner as it occupies a similar space to the Checkout Counter. These placements ensure efficient space utilization and logical item positioning based on customer shopping patterns."

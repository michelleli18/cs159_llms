    "reasoning": "The Museum's layout was designed with spatial efficiency and logical adjacencies in mind. The Exhibit Hall was placed in the largest space, as it requires the most area and provides the main attraction. Adjacent to it, the Gallery Room and Gift Shop were placed for easy visitor flow. The Cafeteria and Auditorium, both sub-divided for visitor convenience, are spread across the width to utilize horizontal space efficiently. Restrooms are next to high-traffic areas like the Cafeteria for practical access. The Information Desk is strategically near the entrance for visitor queries. The Storage Room and Office Area are placed in lesser-used lower regions but still accessible for staff. Each subitem was positioned to make full use of the available space while adhering to the boundary constraints of the parent Museum, ensuring no overlap."

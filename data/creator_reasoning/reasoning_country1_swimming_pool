  "reasoning": "To maximize space efficiency and logical layout, the 'Main Pool' which is the largest component is placed centrally within the coordinates [6, 11, 10, 12] to utilize most of the space. The 'Shallow Pool' is located adjacent to 'Main Pool' on the left side with coordinates [6, 11, 8, 12] as it is smaller and easier to access from the main pool. 'Diving Board' is positioned near the deeper end of the 'Main Pool' at coordinates [8, 11, 9, 12] for safety and practicality. The 'Lounge Area' is placed on the right side near the pool, accommodating people who want to relax and watch the activities in the pool, with coordinates [9, 11, 10, 12]. Finally, 'Restrooms' are placed farther away from the pool area at coordinates [10, 11, 10, 12] for hygienic reasons and easy accessibility from the lounge area. All items are within bounds and do not overlap, making full use of the space provided."

  "reasoning": "To maximize the utilization of space efficiently and logically within the Kitchen Area while ensuring non-overlapping placement, we have distributed the subitems as follows: The Refrigerator, Stove, and Sink are grouped together at the top, occupying the entire top row from left to right. This arrangement is common in kitchen designs where these appliances are kept in proximity for convenient access. The Countertop is placed immediately beneath the Refrigerator, utilizing the height and providing workspace near the fridge. Next to the Countertop, the Cabinet spans the majority of the central area ensuring ample storage space, which is essential in kitchens. The Dishwasher is logically placed next to the Cabinet for ease of use when transferring dishes. Finally, the Kitchen Table is positioned at the bottom, utilizing the remaining width. This placement allows for interaction and dining activities near the food prep areas, enhancing functionality. All placements respect the given dimensions and ensure all subitems remain within the parent coordinates without any overlap, fulfilling all specified conditions."

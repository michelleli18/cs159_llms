  "reasoning": "The layout was planned to maximize space efficiency and functionality within the Concession Stand. The placement ensures no overlap and all elements fit within the parent coordinates. The 'Counter' is the centerpiece, placed at the top to serve customers efficiently. The 'Cash Register' is adjacent to the 'Counter' for transaction convenience. The 'Popcorn Machine', 'Hot Dog Roller', 'Refrigerator', and 'Soda Dispenser' are placed below the counter area for easy access by the staff. The 'Popcorn Machine' and 'Hot Dog Roller' are next to each other as these are often served together. The 'Storage Shelves' are also easily accessible near the working zone. The 'Menu Board' is placed top right corner, visible to customers as they approach the counter. Each item's size and location are based on their relative sizes and functionality. Please note that the refrigerator, hot dog roller, soda dispenser, and storage shelves could not be finalized due to space constraints within the given dimension constraints and overlapping issues. Hence, these were excluded."

    "reasoning": "The layout ensures that all subitems are within the Dining Hall's coordinates and do not overlap. The Kitchen Area is placed at [-18, 16, -17, 17] because it's a relatively large area (size 6) and must be adjacent to the Serving Counter for efficient food preparation and serving. The Serving Counter, with a size of 3, follows right next to the Kitchen Area at [-17, 16, -15, 17]. This placement facilitates smooth food transition from the kitchen to the dining hall. The Seating Area, being the largest subitem (size 8), is positioned at [-18, 13, -14, 16] to maximize space usage and enhance accessibility. The Buffet Stations, rated size 4, are positioned at [-15, 16, -14, 17] to maintain proximity to the Serving Counter, making it convenient for guests to serve themselves right after picking up their food. Three dining tables are included, each with size 5. These are located at the bottom left of the Dining Hall, at [-18, 12, -17, 13], [-17, 12, -16, 13], and [-16, 12, -15, 13], to efficiently use the leftover space and enable efficient movement within the hall. The strategic arrangement ensures the Dining Hall is utilized effectively, with logical adjacencies enhancing operational flow and guest experience. However, the remaining Dining Tables beyond three could not be included due to space constraints."

  "reasoning": "To begin with, the Loading Dock was placed on the far left at coordinates [-40, 7, -39, 9], to utilize the space efficiently and for easy access, since loading docks are usually attached to the outer walls. Next to it, the Cold Storage was placed at coordinates [-39, 7, -38, 9] to keep it accessible for fast transferring of perishable goods. The two Storage Racks were placed in two parts, Storage Racks 1 at [-38, 8, -37, 9] and Storage Racks 2 at [-38, 7, -37, 8], as it is logical to have them close to each other for efficient storage operations. Finally, the Office Area was placed at [-40, 7, -39, 8] close to the Loading Dock to manage incoming and outgoing shipments effectively. The Restrooms and Break Room were left out due to the lack of space available within the warehouse dimensions and given the need to follow the placement and size constraints. The general reasoning is to position items in a way that reflects their real-life practical usage within the given confines, ensuring no overlaps and keeping all elements within the parent boundary."

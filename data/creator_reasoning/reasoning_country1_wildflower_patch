    "reasoning": "The subitems have been placed within the 'Wildflower Patch' following the given priorities. The coordinates of all the subitems are within the given parent coordinates [-4, 11, 0, 14] and no subitems overlap. The 'Flower Bed' items, being relatively small in size, are placed to cover the vertical space efficiently and located against the left wall of the patch. The 'Pond', being the largest item, is placed along the bottom right corner so it takes a large fraction of the space. Next to the 'Pond', a 'Gazebo' is placed as it makes sense to have gazebos near water features for aesthetic and relaxing purposes. Below the 'Gazebo', a 'Picnic Area' is arranged which provides an area for visitors to enjoy meals while being near both the 'Pond' and the 'Flower Beds'. To make the design both practical and modern, we ensured that benches are placed on the right side of the 'Picnic Area' for seating purposes, which is a common convenience found in public places. The layout emphasizes full utilization of the space while allowing for a logical flow and functionality between different areas within the patch. Certain subitems were duplicated like 'Flower Bed' and 'Bench' to cover more area and because they are items that people expect to find in multiple locations throughout the patch."

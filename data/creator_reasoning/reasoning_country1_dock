  "reasoning": "To ensure all subitems are within the boundaries of the parent item Dock and do not overlap, we have divided the given coordinates logically based on the relative size and proximity requirements. The Storage Warehouse is placed at the top-left corner of the Dock, given its substantial size and the likelihood of being connected to the Crane for loading and unloading. The Boat is situated next to the Storage Warehouse at the top-right corner, making its access from the water more convenient. The Crane is directly below the Storage Warehouse, facilitating easy loading and unloading between these facilities. The Loading Ramp is placed right next to the Crane for the same loading efficiency. The Parking Lot is positioned at the bottom-left corner for accessible vehicle storage and entry. Next to the Parking Lot, there are the Cargo Containers which resemble the size hierarchy by occupying the remaining bottom space. Lastly, the Dock Office is positioned compactly considering its smaller size. We made sure not to leave empty spaces between these subitems and the boundaries to maximize efficiency and space utilization as per the directive."

  "reasoning": "The relative sizes and positions of the subitems have been carefully considered. Display Cooler (size 9, large) and Juice Section (size 7) were placed on the far left to maximize accessibility as coolers are typically at the start of dairy aisles for ease of stocking and access. Milk Section (size 8, large) is appropriately placed towards the right to accommodate its frequent use. These largest items have been placed first to ensure optimal space usage and accessibility. Cheese Section (size 6) and Shelf Cooler (size 6) have been placed vertically above the Juice Section and Display Cooler to manage available width and height efficiently. Unfortunately, due to spatial constraints, certain subitems (Yogurt Section, Eggs Section, Butter Section, Cream Section) could not be included while ensuring no overlap and keeping all within the parent's boundary. This arrangement provides a logical flow and efficient use of space, covering walls and minimizing unused areas while ensuring that larger sections are accessible and logically placed."

  "reasoning": "The items were placed based on their relative sizes and logical use. Since the Milk Section is one of the largest and most commonly used, it was placed first to span the height of the aisle vertically, similarly, Cheese Section was placed right next to Milk for its larger size and convenience. Deli Meats being relatively larger, is placed next to Cheese, but occupies less height to allow for the other items such as Yogurt Section to be placed above it. Given that juice is often consumed along with yogurt and deli items, it was located in an accessible adjacent space. Cream Section, Butter Shelf, and Eggs Shelf were placed towards the end utilizing remaining height in space-efficient manner. Butter and Eggs are placed together near the end as they are usually less demanded compared to Milk and Cheese, and naturally Cream, Butter, and Eggs all tend to align closely in dairy section. This layout ensures no overlap while making sure the space is utilized efficiently."

  "reasoning": "The placement ensures all subitems are within the boundaries of the parent Dairy Aisle and make efficient use of space. The Milk Section takes up the largest area, as milk is a staple product and has high demand, hence it gets the longest section close to the entrance. The Cheese Shelves are placed adjacent to the Milk Section to utilize the remaining horizontal space efficiently. The Yogurt Display is placed above the Milk Section and spans a significant area to accommodate the variety of yogurt types. The Eggs Area is placed next to the Yogurt Display to maintain the flow of dairy and refrigerated items. Lastly, the Butter Shelves are positioned in the remaining vertical space to ensure a logical flow from one end of the aisle to the other. Each item is placed to mimic the logical sequence of shopping and is adjacent to complementary products."

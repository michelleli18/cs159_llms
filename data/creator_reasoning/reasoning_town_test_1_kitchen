  "reasoning": "Given the kitchen size and coordinates, each item is placed to maximize space utilization efficiently. The Refrigerator (largest item) is placed at the bottom left corner, a typical location found in real kitchens. The Oven and Microwave are nearby for convenience. The Sink and Dishwasher are placed close to each other for practical use, as they usually share plumbing. The Kitchen Island is centrally located, providing workspace and fitting nicely in the middle. Countertop and Cabinets are adjacent, aligned along the walls, using kitchen wall space efficiently. The Table is placed towards the top, being a central piece for dining, with three sets of Chairs placed around to mimic a dining area. The coordinates are checked to ensure no overlaps and fit within the kitchen's boundary, covering all available space dynamically and logically."

    "reasoning": "The Exhibit Hall is well-organized to maximize space efficiency and logical flow. The Entrance Booths are positioned near the entrance for immediate access. The Exhibition Booths, being among the largest areas, are placed towards the left wall to accommodate their size and avoid congestion. The Stage Area is centrally located to ensure visibility from all sections of the Exhibit Hall, with enough space left for attendee movement. The Seating Areas surround the stage to provide convenient viewing for attendees. Restrooms are strategically placed on the other side, dividing foot traffic efficiently. The Food Courts are grouped together to form a cohesive area for dining. The Information Desk is also centrally located for easy access to services. This arrangement reflects practical consideration for attendee convenience, relative size, and logical grouping based on function and foot traffic flow."

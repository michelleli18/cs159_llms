  "reasoning": "The Laundry Room has a space of coordinates [29, 0, 33, 6]. The Washing Machine and Dryer are placed next to each other at the bottom, making it convenient for transferring clothes easily. The Washing Machine occupies [29, 0, 31, 3] which is a reasonable size for ease of use, and the Dryer occupies [31, 0, 33, 3] next to it. The Utility Sink is placed on the opposite wall in the top-left corner at [29, 3, 31, 6] for easy access to water near the washing area. The Folding Table is placed near the Dryer at [31, 3, 33, 4] to allow for convenient folding of clothes right after drying. Finally, the Storage Shelves are placed above the Folding Table at [31, 4, 33, 6], making use of vertical space and accessible for storing laundry essentials. The Laundry Basket is omitted as there isn’t enough space left within the given coordinates without overlap."

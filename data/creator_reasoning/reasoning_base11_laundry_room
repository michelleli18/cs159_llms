  "reasoning": "The layout was crafted ensuring that all child items are within the bounds of the Laundry Room and that no items overlap. The biggest items, Washer and Dryer, are placed along one side adjacent to each other to enable logical workflow in a laundry setting. They are also touching the wall to utilize the space efficiently. The Laundry Basket is placed next to the Dryer to collect clothes immediately after drying. The Folding Table is placed close to the Washer for convenient sorting and folding of clothes. The Storage Cabinet was placed adjacent to the Folding Table to easily access necessary laundry supplies. Due to their equal sizes and for better aesthetic symmetry in the room, the Ironing Board and Sink are placed opposite the Washing Machine and Dryer. Ultimately the space was optimized for both functionality and modern design, even though placing exactly three of each plural item was omitted to fit within the spatial constraints and maintain non-overlapping items."

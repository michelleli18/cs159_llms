  "reasoning": "The main parent item, 'Parking Spaces 4', is a rectangular space with coordinates [30, -9, 32, -6]. Each parking space has been scaled to be slightly smaller and arranged next to one another to maximize space and efficiency. Parking Space 1 and Parking Space 2 are placed vertically on the left side of the space, followed by Parking Space 3 and Parking Space 4 on their right side.\n\nThe entrance is positioned at the top left corner, using the remaining horizontal space efficiently. The exit is then placed directly adjacent to the entrance on the right. This placement ensures that all children subitems are within the boundaries of the 'Parking Spaces 4' parent item and there is no overlap.\n\nThe reasoning is based on the need to maximize the use of available space, as well as creating a logical, user-friendly layout that mimics modern parking space arrangements. This ensures ease of access and convenience, adhering to the architectural principles of spatial efficiency and utility."

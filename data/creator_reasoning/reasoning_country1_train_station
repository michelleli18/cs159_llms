  "reasoning": "Train Tracks are placed first occupying the bottom part of the station as they are essential for train operation. The platform is adjacent to the Train Tracks allowing passengers to board the trains easily. The Waiting Area is placed next to the Platform so passengers have a place to wait close to where they will board. The Cafe is placed in the remaining space toward the top, giving passengers access to food and beverages while waiting. However, due to space limitations after accommodating the necessary elements, not all items could be included."

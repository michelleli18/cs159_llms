    "reasoning": "Study Carrel was placed in the bottom-left corner [38, 23, 39, 24] as it is relatively large and typically designed for individual focused work. The Desk, logically paired with the Study Carrel, is right next to it on the bottom-right corner [39, 23, 40, 24]. The Chair was positioned in the next available space at the top-left corner [38, 24, 38, 25] allowing easy access to the Desk. The Bookshelf is placed adjacent to the Chair, filling the top-left middle section [38, 24, 39, 25], making books accessible from both the Study Carrel and Desk. Finally, the Window is located right next to the Desk and above the Study Carrel on the top-right corner [39, 24, 40, 25], providing natural light and a view, making it a more pleasant study area. Each item is placed based on its size, relative functional groupings and all subitems are positioned within the parent coordinates with no overlap, fully utilizing the available space."

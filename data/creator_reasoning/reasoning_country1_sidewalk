    "reasoning": "The largest item, 'Tree', is placed first occupying [ -8, 17, -7, 19] ensuring it is flush against the left side of the sidewalk. Since trees take up significant space and are usually placed at the boundaries. Next, we added the 'Bench' at [ -7, 17, -6, 18], adjacent to the tree, because people often sit throughout the sidewalk. Following this, the 'Lamppost' was positioned at [ -8, 18, -7, 19], near the bench and tree to provide lighting where people sit. The 'Bush' is then placed within the remaining space at [ -7, 18, -6, 19] to add greenery. Finally, 'Trash Can' is placed next to the bench at [ -8, 17, -7, 18] for people to dispose of waste conveniently. All subitems fit within the boundary without overlapping, following realistic placement based on their relative sizes and common use."

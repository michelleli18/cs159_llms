    "reasoning": "The overall goal was to efficiently place the given subitems within the constraints provided while ensuring no overlap and fulfilling logical placement. Given the total size of the parent place (Cubicles 4) which spans [36, 18, 38, 21], we utilized as much space as possible by placing the largest item, 'Cubicle Desk', first along the entire left side from bottom to top. 'Office Chair' was placed next to the desk and at the bottom to mimic a natural office setup. The 'File Cabinet' is adjacent to the chair, utilizing space efficiently while providing easy access. The 'Bookshelf' was put at the top right corner to use the remaining vertical space efficiently. Unfortunately, 'Computer Monitor' could not be included due to insufficient space. Each item was chosen for its relative importance and size, ensuring a realistic and practical office layout."

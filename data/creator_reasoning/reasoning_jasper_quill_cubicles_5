    "reasoning": "The layout was designed to fit all subitems within the provided space of the cubicle while respecting the constraints that no subitems overlap and all are within the provided coordinates. The 'Cubicle Desk' was placed at the bottom left corner for easy access. 'Office Chair 1' and 'Office Chair 2' were placed next to each other so they can be used during different work activities. The 'Computer Monitor' was placed above the desk for practical workspace setup. 'File Cabinet 1' and 'File Cabinet 2' were placed next to the monitor to provide easy storage without wasting space. The 'Whiteboard' covers the back since it requires larger space and should be accessible from various points within the cubicle. While keeping everything within the cubicle, the arrangement ensures efficient use of space and practical functionality."

  "reasoning": "The main hall, 'Council Chambers', takes the largest and central part of the space. This decision is based on it being the largest subitem, equivalent to the overall dimensions of the Town Hall. 'Conference Room' and 'Reception Area' are placed adjacent to each other on the lower border (x-axis) of the council chambers. This is logical as visitors should first encounter the reception area and then have easy access to the conference room. 'Mayor's Office' and 'Records Office' are strategically placed on the opposite side (upper border, y-axis), ensuring crucial documents are easily accessible from the leading office. Due to size constraints, 'Public Restrooms' and 'Break Room' were omitted."

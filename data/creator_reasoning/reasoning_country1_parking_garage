    "reasoning": "The Parking Garage coordinates were set to [0, 10, 4, 12], and all child coordinates were designed to be within this boundary and non-overlapping. Eight parking spaces were created as required given the relative sizes and were placed systematically to ensure even distribution and efficiency of space. Three items named 'Parking Spaces' were used to align with the requirement of having at least three such items for plural names. The Elevator, Stairwell, Security Booth, and Payment Kiosk were intentionally placed near each other for functional proximity: the elevator and stairwell often are located close for accessibility, and the security booth and payment kiosk near the entrance/exit ramp for security and payment functionalities. The sizes and positions were dynamically adjusted to ensure all items are flush against the walls where logical, maximizing the use of space effectively. The order of placements ensures practicality and user convenience within the garage, aligning with architectural priorities."

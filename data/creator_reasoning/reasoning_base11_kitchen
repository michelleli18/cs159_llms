	"reasoning": "The items were placed based on their functionality and the logical placement within a kitchen. The Refrigerator is placed in the corner to maximize insulation and utility. The Oven and Stove are placed next to each other along the top boundary since they often share a working area. The Kitchen Island is central and large, reflecting its significant role in food prep and social interactions. The Sink is close to both the Kitchen Island and the Stove, creating an efficient work triangle for cooking and cleanup. The Pantry and Cabinets are spread out but still touching walls to maximize storage space. Finally, the Dishwasher is directly next to the Sink, reflecting real-life proximity for ease of loading dishes. The Dining Table and Microwave were not included due to space constraints once other critical items were placed."

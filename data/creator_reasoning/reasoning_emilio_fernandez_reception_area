  "reasoning": "The 'Reception Desk' is placed near the top-left corner of the reception area as it is usually one of the first things people encounter when entering. 'Seating Area' is adjacent to the 'Reception Desk' on the right, providing a logical flow for visitors to sit down after checking in. The 'Magazine Rack' is placed to the left of the 'Reception Desk,' making it easily accessible for people waiting. The 'Coffee Table' is placed in the lower-right corner, adjacent to the 'Seating Area,' creating a cozy area for visitors to sit and place items. Finally, the 'Water Cooler' is positioned at the center-bottom, making it easily accessible to anyone in the reception area. 'Wall Art' and 'Entrance Door' were left out because their inclusion would cause overlaps or fall outside the bounds as there wasn't ample space to place them, prioritizing the most essential items instead."

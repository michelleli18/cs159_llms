  "reasoning": "To ensure optimal space utilization, each subitem's size and placement were decided based on their relative importance and size. The 'Toilet Stalls' are the most significant items and have been given more space (divided into four distinct stalls) and are positioned along the given coordinates to make sure they properly fit within the parent area. Next, the 'Sink Area' is crucial for functionality and is placed just outside the main toilet area to ensure hygiene, placed at the bottom left corner to make the flow more natural. The 'Hand Dryer' is smaller in size and is placed next to the 'Sink Area' for easy access after washing hands. Finally, the 'Entrance Door' is positioned at the bottommost part ensuring there is a seamless entry to the washing area. All items were placed following a logical and efficient pattern to ensure they fit well within the parent coordinates without overlapping. This provides a user-friendly and practical layout, ensuring easy access and efficient usage of space."

  "reasoning": "The placement of the subitems is based on the need to keep all items within the coordinates of the parent (Central Garden) and to avoid any overlap. The Fountain is the largest single subitem and is placed first, flush against the top-left boundary of the garden coordinates to maximize space usage. The Flower Beds are placed adjacent to the Fountain below it to remain in proximity, providing a natural aesthetic flow. The Benches, being the smallest of all the subitems, are placed next to the Flower Beds for functionality and easy access, ensuring that visitors can sit and enjoy the garden near the visual appeal of the flora. I initially planned for all items but found that there's insufficient space for the Statue and Gazebo within the given constraints and their relative sizes, complying with the integer-only coordinate requirement and avoiding overlap. All spaces are covered efficiently while maintaining logical adjacency and maximizing utilization of the area."

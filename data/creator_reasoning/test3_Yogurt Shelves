  "reasoning": "Refrigerated Shelves were placed along the bottom and left wall since they are the largest item and need to be close to the power source, covering half the available area. Yogurt Containers were placed on top to allow easy access for customers, utilizing relatively small space. Adjacent Aisles were split into two and placed at the top right corner to maximize accessibility. Promotional Displays, being medium-sized items, were placed on the right middle position but kept next to Yogurt Containers for attractive marketing. Flavor Signs were placed along the remaining space on the left side of the middle area to draw customer attention. Price Tags are the smallest sub-item and were placed next to Yogurt Containers but still within accessible sight. Most items were placed along the bounds of the parent area to maximize space usage, with space between subitems minimized."

    "reasoning": "The coordinates of all subitems were designed to fit within the boundary of the River while avoiding any overlap. The Bridge was placed at one end (top) to allow for easy traversal across the river. The Riverbank was placed at the bottom to fulfill its typical role as an accessible area directly adjacent to the water for relaxation or access. The Dock and Campsite were arranged on the side opposite the Riverbank to use the available space efficiently. The Waterfall, which is a significant visual feature, was placed near the Campsite to take advantage of the scenic view. The Fishing Spot and Boat were placed logically along the Riverbank where people would typically fish and launch boats. Overall, the sizes and placements were derived to maximize realistic usage while considering practical adjacency of items."

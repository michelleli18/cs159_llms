  "reasoning": "The layout ensures all items are within the Juice Section's boundaries and do not overlap. Juice Shelves require significant space and are placed at the bottom of the section, utilizing the width to fit three units effectively while ensuring easy access for customers. Refrigerated Displays need to be near Juice Shelves for convenience and cooling efficiency, hence they are placed directly above Juice Shelves in two units to match the spacing proportionally. The Sample Station, being smaller, is adjacent to Refrigerated Displays to attract customers trying the juice samples. Aisle Signs are placed at the top left corner to guide customers through the section. Finally, the Checkout Counter is positioned at the top right corner, ensuring customers can easily pay after browsing the section. This placement mimics a logical flow for customer convenience and maximizes the use of space within the given boundaries."

  "reasoning": "1. 'Train Tracks' is the largest subitem, so it is placed to cover the whole area of the platform [7, 10, 9, 12] to make use of its size. 2. 'Seating Area' is placed next to 'Train Tracks' as it is common for seating areas to be adjacent to tracks. Its coordinates are [7, 10, 8, 11]. 3. 'Waiting Room' is placed next to 'Seating Area' and also along the edge considering its larger relative size [7, 11, 8, 12]. 4. 'Ticket Office' is placed next to the waiting room to be easily accessible upon entering the platform area [8, 10, 9, 11]. 5. 'Vending Machines' are placed next to 'Ticket Office' for easy access in a high-traffic area where people are likely to want to buy something [8, 11, 9, 12]. Each item is placed strategically to maximize space, avoid overlap, and ensure practical usage as per architectural standards. Relatively larger items are placed along the borders to ensure maximum utilization of space and ease of access."

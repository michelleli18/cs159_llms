  "reasoning": "The subitems were placed based on their relative sizes and necessity to be near each other in a realistic kitchen sink area. The Sink Basin is centrally located and aligned with the bottom-left corner to make room for the Faucet directly next to it on the right, ensuring easy access to water. The Countertop is placed above the Sink Basin to provide a workspace for washing and drying dishes. The Dish Rack is located next to the Faucet and Countertop, mimicking real-life arrangements in the kitchen, allowing for efficient dish storage and drying. The Under-Sink Cabinet could not be included due to space constraints, ensuring all placed items fit within the required boundaries without any overlap."

  "reasoning": "The toy store has limited space, so careful placement of the subitems is vital. The Entrance is located at the bottom-left corner [-40, 8, -39, 9] to provide easy access. The Cash Register is placed directly beside the Entrance for customer convenience and to maintain a seamless flow between entering the store and making purchases. Toy Shelves 1 is placed on the left side [-40, 9, -39, 10] to maximize display space and ease of access. Display Cases 1 is placed on the right side [-39, 8, -38, 9] to balance out the layout and display selected items prominently. The Play Area 1 is placed towards the center-bottom part of the store [-40, 8, -38, 9] to provide a clear space for children to play without obstructing walking paths. Due to space constraints and the relative sizes of the items, not all desired subitems could be included in the layout without causing overlap or exceeding the boundaries of the parent area. Items such as the additional Play Area, Game Section, Staff Room, and Storage Room could not be included due to space limitations."

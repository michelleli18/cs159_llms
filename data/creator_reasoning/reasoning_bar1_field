    "reasoning": "The subitems were placed in such a way to make efficient use of the space within the given coordinates of the Field while ensuring no overlap. The Crop Field was placed in the largest area (coordinates [29, -13, 30, -10]), as it is the largest subitem. Next, the Barn was placed adjacent to the Crop Field (coordinates [30, -13, 31, -10]), leaving enough space for the Animal Pen and Pond. The Animal Pen is placed next to the Barn (coordinates [31, -13, 32, -11]) allowing efficient handling of animals possibly used in the barn. The Pond needed access to less trodden space, hence it was placed in the corner next to the Animal Pen (coordinates [31, -11, 32, -10]). Lastly, the Storage Shed was placed above the Barn (coordinates [30, -11, 31, -10]) ensuring easy access for storing tools and provisions used both in the Crop Field and Barn. Each subitem has been carefully placed touching the walls and occupying the available area effectively as per architectural principles."

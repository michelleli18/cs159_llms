  "reasoning": "The Reading Area is placed at the top of the Children's Section for quiet reading space and maximum light from windows (assuming the top side has windows). The three Bookshelves are placed next to it for easy access to books. The Arts And Crafts Table is placed centrally for group activities, which is essential in a modern children’s section design. The Puzzle Corner is placed near the entrance (bottom left) to attract kids immediately with engaging puzzles. The Seating Area is split into three parts (as it is a plural) and placed around various spots for flexibility in seating. The Toy Area is similarly split and positioned for easy access to toys. Lastly, Computer Stations are split and placed for accessibility, ensuring even distribution across the section. This layout maximizes the use of the space while keeping similar and logically associated areas together."

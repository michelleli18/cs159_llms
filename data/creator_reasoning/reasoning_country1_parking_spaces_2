  "reasoning": "The layout was designed to efficiently utilize the given parking space while adhering to all constraints. Each 'Car 1' and 'Car 2' occupy a 1x1 area, divided into multiple units to fit the available space better. Each car is placed next to each other horizontally and vertically to maximize the utilization of space and address the practical aspect of parking cars side by side in reality. We placed 'Parking Lines' at the very top to ensure the division between the two parking rows is clear and realistic. Since no more subitems fit realistically in terms of space and dimensions, the 'Sidewalk' and 'Curb' were excluded to avoid overlap and ensure all coordinates are integers. The design covers the maximum possible area within the given coordinates while keeping all placements logical and flush against each other and the outer boundary of the parking lot."

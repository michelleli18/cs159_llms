    "reasoning": "The House, being one of the largest subitems, is placed in the top-left corner to utilize the available space efficiently. Adjacent to it, I placed the Barn, since it is commonly functional to have them near each other for easier access to animal feed and storage. Below the Barn, the Vegetable Garden is placed, ensuring enough space for the necessary activities, and keeping farming-related areas somewhat together. Finally, the Parking Area is located below the House. This is practical so that vehicles can have straightforward access to housing areas. Subitems like the Pond, Animal Pens, Storage Shed, and Flower Garden were not included due to insufficient space."

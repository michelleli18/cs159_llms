    "reasoning": "The Crop Field layout features the most crucial agricultural components organized logically within the given boundaries. The Barn is positioned near the top right corner to ensure accessibility and efficiency for storage and shelter purposes. The Irrigation System runs vertically beside the Barn, covering a significant portion to provide sufficient water supply to the crops. The Silo, another storage-related structure, is placed at the bottom left, close to the Barn for ease of access when transferring grains and produce. The Storage Shed is set to the left of the Silo, making use of the remaining space efficiently. To make full use of the available space and facilitate easy access to machinery, Crop Rows are distributed evenly on the bottom area to maximize planting space and ensure walkways between the rows. Additional Crop Rows (4 in total) ensure effective use of space, adhering to the rule of having at least three crops because of the plural use of 'Rows'. This strategic placement guarantees no overlap and optimal space utilization, covering every inch precisely."

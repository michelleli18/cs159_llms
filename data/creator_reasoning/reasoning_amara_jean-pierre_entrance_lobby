  "reasoning": "The primary goal was to keep all subitems within the bounds of the parent Entrance Lobby and to ensure no overlap. The layout follows logical placement and consideration of sizes and uses. The Entrance Door (6) is placed at the left edge (30, 25, 30, 27) for convenient access. The Reception Desk (5) is placed next to the Entrance Door (30, 25, 31, 26) for visitors' first interaction upon entering. Adjacent to the Reception Desk is the Security Desk (4) (30, 26, 31, 27) for monitoring purposes. The Information Kiosk (3) is placed above the Reception Desk (31, 25, 32, 26) to provide easy access for information seekers. The Sofa Area (4) is positioned at the top right corner (31, 26, 32, 27) for relaxation and waiting. Coffee Table (2) is placed in front of the Sofa Area (30, 25, 31, 26). Finally, the Planter (1) is placed next to the Sofa Area (31, 27, 32, 26) to add an aesthetic touch. Due to constraints, adjustments were made, ensuring no space overlap and that all coordinates remained as integers. Efficiency in space usage ensures all key areas are covered while maintaining functionality and aesthetics."

  "reasoning": "The given coordinates for the University are [-31, 7, -26, 12]. Considering the relative sizes and the priorities given: The largest subitems like the Library, Dormitory, and Auditorium were placed first as they occupy more space and need logical accessibility. The Library, being central to student activities, was placed in the top right corner for easy access. The Dormitory was placed adjacent to the Library on the left for student convenience. The Auditorium is logically placed next to the Dormitory and Library for ease of access for events and large gatherings. The Lecture Hall is placed adjacent to the Dormitory, for easy accessibility for students. Only these four subitems could be included within the given space without overlap, and the remaining subitems such as Laboratory, Cafeteria, Gymnasium, Administrative Building, Bookstore, and Parking Lot were not included due to lack of sufficient space. The arrangement ensures all the children are within the bounds of the University and covers the given coordinates efficiently."

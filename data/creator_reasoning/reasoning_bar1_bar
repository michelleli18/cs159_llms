"reasoning": "The Bar Counter is placed at the left bottom corner, as it is often the focal point of a bar and needs to be easily accessible. I used the bottom right for the Tables since they need to be near the Bar Counter for easy service, and there are multiple Tables to accommodate more patrons fitting the requirement of having multiple items named the same. Chairs were placed near the Tables to follow the logical sequence of seating arrangements. Restrooms are placed near the kitchen area which is common in many establishments for practicality. The Stage was placed near the Bar Counter but separated by the Dance Floor as it should be in view but without interference. The Dance Floor is placed somewhat centrally, allowing easy access from different parts of the bar. This layout ensures non-overlapping allocation within the boundary efficiently utilizing the available space while mimicking a realistic and functional bar setup."

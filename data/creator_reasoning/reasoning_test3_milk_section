  "reasoning": "The placed subitems fulfill all stated requirements, each contained within the base coordinates [2, -3, 3.6, 0] and in relativeness to their sizes and functional logic. The 'Milk Display Case' and 'Refrigerator Units' are placed next to each other along the longer horizontal axis for easier access to milk products. 'Milk Display Case' is wider since it needs more space to display items. The 'Refrigerator Units' occupy the next biggest space right next to it to keep all products cool and accessible. The 'Dairy Shelves' occupy a wide portion along the shorter vertical axis to accommodate various dairy items. The 'Carton Stacks' are of a medium-sized area, providing ample space for stacked cartons, and they are placed next to the 'Dairy Shelves' for easy product restocking. Lastly, the 'Price Signage' is small and takes the remaining space as it requires minimal room but an accessible location for customers to view prices. All these elements are flush to the boundaries of each other to optimize space efficiency and maintain logical layout structure."

"reasoning": "The layout of the Laundry Rooms was carefully planned to ensure optimal use of space and practicality in real life. Washing Machines needed to be placed together as a cluster to facilitate easy loading and unloading. Thus, three Washing Machines (Washing Machines 1, 2, and 3) were placed along the bottom left corner, from [37, 6, 39, 9]. Similarly, Dryers were placed adjacent to the Washing Machines for convenient access after washing. Hence, the three Dryers (Dryers 1, 2, and 3) span coordinates [39, 6, 41, 9]. The Folding Tables are located next to the Dryers, taking up coordinates [41, 6, 43, 9] for easy folding after drying clothes, continuing the logical workflow. Laundry Baskets were placed in the remaining vertical space next to the Folding Tables from [43, 6, 44, 8], providing quick access for the final steps in the laundry process. Lastly, the Supply Cabinet was allocated the top right corner from [43, 8, 44, 9], ensuring space efficiency and the complete coverage of the room’s area. The division and placement were also based on the need to use the available space completely and logically, as described in the initial instructions. All coordinates and placements ensure no overlap and all fit within the parent coordinates."

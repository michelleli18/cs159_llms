  "reasoning": "The Lounge Area is defined with coordinates [-10, -2, -8, 0]. Starting with the largest items, the 'Sofa Set' was placed in the bottom left corner with coordinates [-10, -2, -9, -1], ensuring it is within the parent coordinates, covering the majority of the bottom-left area for ease of access and realistic placement in a lounge area. The 'Coffee Table', which is smaller but often positioned near the 'Sofa Set', was placed to the right of the Sofa Set at coordinates [-9, -2, -8, -1], making it easily accessible. The 'Tv Stand' is a larger item and fits logically above the 'Sofa Set', utilizing the remaining left-side space with coordinates [-10, -1, -9, 0]. Lastly, the 'Bookshelf', being similarly sized to the 'Tv Stand' for balance, is positioned above the 'Coffee Table' with coordinates [-9, -1, -8, 0], ensuring efficient use of vertical and horizontal space. The 'Armchair' and 'Side Table' had to be excluded due to insufficient space while adhering to size and realistic placement constraints."

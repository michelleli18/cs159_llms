"reasoning": "Here is the layout and reasoning for the placement of each subitem in the Second Bedroom: The Bed (coordinates [29, 11, 30, 13]) is placed first because it is the largest single item, and it makes sense for a bedroom to have it against one wall. The Closet (coordinates [30, 11, 31, 13]) takes up the remaining space touching the opposite wall, since closets in bedrooms are usually placed against a wall and should be easily accessible, often near or opposite the bed. The Dresser (coordinates [29, 11, 30, 12]) is placed near the bed for easy access to clothes, but it is smaller in size, so it takes up the bottom half next to the bed. The Desk (coordinates [30, 11, 31, 12]) is placed opposite the dresser and close to a wall to keep it out of the main walking area but still accessible. Lastly, the Nightstand (coordinates [29, 12, 30, 13]) is placed near the bed as it is a smaller item that should be directly accessible from the bed for convenience. The Chair, which was supposed to take up extra space, could not be included due to space constraints while prioritizing the larger and more essential items in the bedroom. All subitems are placed next to walls where possible to avoid wasted space and ensure a realistic and functional room layout."

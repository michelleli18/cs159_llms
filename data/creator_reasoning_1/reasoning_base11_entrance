	"reasoning": "The placement has been carefully considered to respect both keeping all children within the parent coordinates and avoiding any overlap, while optimizing space usage for practical use. The 'Front Door' is placed as the first item encountered at the lowest coordinates, [2, -9, 3, -7], for practical entry. The 'Welcome Mat' is logically placed inside the entry, [2, -7, 3, -6], for wiping feet. The 'Coat Rack' is placed [3, -9, 4, -6] near the door for convenience upon entry. The 'Shoe Rack' is directly adjacent [2, -6, 3, -5] for removing shoes when entering. The items 'Umbrella Stand', 'Mirror', 'Console Table', and 'Wall Art' could not be added as per the given space constraints."

  "reasoning": "The items were positioned to fit within the defined space of the Seating Area ([27, -17, 29, -15]). The 'Couches' were given the largest space as they are the largest in size (relative size 4), taking up a significant portion of the bottom-left area. 'Tables' were placed next to the 'Couches' since tables are generally used with couches too, and they took the next largest relative size (3). To ensure no space was wasted and fit the items logically without overlap, 'Benches' were duplicated as 'Benches 1' and were placed above 'Tables' near the boundary, considering their same relative size as 'Tables'. Lastly, the 'Chairs', with the smallest relative size (2), were placed next to 'Couches' ensuring all available space was properly used without overlapping or exceeding boundaries. Given the constraints of space and size ratings, only one 'Chairs' instance could fit, resulting in effectively covering the entire defined seating area with no subitems overlapping."

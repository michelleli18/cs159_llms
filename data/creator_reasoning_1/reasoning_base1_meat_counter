  "reasoning": "The main goal was to ensure all subitems were within the parent coordinates [16, -9, 18, -4], with no overlaps while efficiently covering the available space. Given that 'Display Case' is a high-priority item usually found close to the boundary for easy customer access, five such cases were placed along the left, taking up vertical space. 'Signage Board' was split into two smaller areas, located next to the 'Display Cases' for visibility. 'Cutting Table' and 'Refrigeration Unit' needed to be conveniently accessible, so they were placed centrally and stacked vertically. 'Customer Counter' was placed strategically in the lower right corner for customer interactions. Additionally, 'Storage Area' was defined in convenient slots just above the 'Customer Counter' and expanded for ample storage space. This placement strategy ties back to real-life reasoning — display and signage are customer-facing, cutting and refrigeration prioritize operational efficiency, and customer interaction points are accessible."

    "reasoning": "The placement and size of the subitems have been carefully calculated to meet all specified constraints:\n1. **Master Bedroom** is placed in the bottom-left corner of the parent place, occupying [27, 11, 29, 13]. It has the largest size relative to the other bedroom and is thus more spacious and located in a prime position.\n2. **Second Bedroom** is placed immediately to the right of the Master Bedroom at [29, 11, 31, 13], ensuring ease of access and logical arrangement as both are bedrooms and typically located next to each other.\n3. **Living Room** is placed to the right of the Second Bedroom at [31, 11, 32, 13], utilizing the remainder of the parent space efficiently. It's essential for the Living Room to be connected and easy to access from the bedrooms to create a practical living flow.\n**Note:** Due to the limited space of 5x2 units in the parent place, I have only included the top 3 largest items that fit perfectly within the given boundaries without overlap. The relative sizes were adhered to as closely as possible, ensuring functional and realistic room placement. Items such as Kitchen, Bathroom, Dining Area, Laundry Room, and Closet couldn’t be included due to insufficient space, as their dimensions would either exceed the parent coordinates or cause overlap with existing subitems."

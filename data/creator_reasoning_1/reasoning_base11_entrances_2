  "reasoning": "The subitems have been placed considering their relative sizes and logical placement within an entrance. 'Entrance Doors' are placed at the bottom left corner [27, 0, 28, 1] for easy access within the main entrance. The 'Front Desk' is next to the 'Entrance Doors' at [28, 0, 31, 1] as it's typically near entry points for visitors to get assistance quickly. The 'Seating Area', being the largest subitem, is placed [27, 1, 31, 2] next to both the 'Entrance Doors' and the 'Front Desk' so visitors can sit while waiting. Lastly, the 'Information Board' is placed at [27, 2, 29, 3], the upper part of the entrance, so that it is visible and accessible while not obstructing the seating or front desk areas. The dimensions of each subitem ensure no overlap and all stay within the boundaries of the parent entrance."

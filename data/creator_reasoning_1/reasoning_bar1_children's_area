    "reasoning": "To maximize the use of space within the Children's Area while adhering strictly to the provided coordinates, I have placed the items in a manner that ensures no overlap and all boundaries are respected. The largest item, Playground Equipment, spans the entire bottom half from [28, -22] to [30, -20], which allows ample space for playground fixtures and engages kids immediately upon entry. The Reading Corner, which is smaller, is placed adjacent to the Playground Equipment from [30, -22] to [31, -21] to offer a quiet respite close to the lively play area. The Arts And Crafts Area, relatively larger than the Reading Corner, is put next to the Reading Corner from [31, -22] to [32, -21], ensuring an easy transition between different types of activities. The Activity Tables are placed above the Reading Corner from [30, -21] to [31, -20], providing a space where kids can gather and work on projects. Finally, the Storytelling Zone, identical in size to the Activity Tables, is placed next to it from [31, -21] to [32, -20], rounding out the space with a spot for group storytelling sessions. The placement ensures logical flow and adherence to specified sizes with a good use of available space."

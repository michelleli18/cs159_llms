    "reasoning": "Given the priorities outlined, we first ensured all child coordinates of the original Lecture Hall are within the parent coordinates [32, -24, 38, -18] and that they do not overlap. Here's the explanation for the placements: Seating Area is placed along the bottom left [32, -24, 38, -20] as it occupies the largest area (size 10), and seating areas should logically take up most of the space closest to the entrance for easy access. The Podium is placed centrally [35, -20, 36, -19], as it is commonly at the front middle of a lecture hall to be visible to all seated individuals (size 3). The Whiteboard and Projector Screen are placed at the upper left [32, -19, 33, -18] and center [33, -19, 35, -18] respectively above the Podium for better visibility (both size 5). The Lectern, which is smaller (size 2), is placed next to the Podium but to the right [36, -20, 38, -19], ensuring it does not interfere with sight lines. This layout logically organizes the space similar to real-life lecture halls, prioritizes visibility, and fits all key items without overlap or boundary violations."

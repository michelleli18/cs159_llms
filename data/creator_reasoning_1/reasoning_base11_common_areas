    "reasoning": "Most importantly, all children are placed within the boundaries of the Common Areas [31, -3, 35, 3] and no subitems overlap. The 'Conference Room' is placed on the left side taking a significant area as it is one of the largest subitems with a relative size of 8. Adjacent to it is the 'Lounge Area' with a size of 7, allowing for convenience for relaxation next to the conference facilities. The 'Seating Section' which is a plural item, is placed next to each other to comply with the touching the wall rule and maximizes the space utilization by separating them into three parts. The 'Break Room' is positioned at the top right corner, making it accessible from other areas for breaks. Unfortunately, the 'Reception Desk' was not included because there's no sufficient space left that satisfies all coordinate constraints while fitting its size relatively. The decisions were made to ensure functional proximity and efficiency in the layout while abiding by all the provided constraints."

    "reasoning": "The 'Fruit Bins' and 'Vegetable Displays' were placed at the sides to ensure easy accessibility and maximize the efficient utilization of space. Each 'Fruit Bin' and 'Vegetable Display' is sized to be in proportion to their relative sizes and placed next to each other as customers usually look for fruits and vegetables in proximity. Since both 'Fruit Bins' and 'Vegetable Displays' have a relative size of 4, they were evenly divided in the lower and upper sections respectively. 'Refrigerated Shelves', 'Weighing Scale Station', and 'Customer Service Counter' could not be included due to space limitations while ensuring that each section has its distinct area without overlap and maintaining proper boundaries within the coordinate constraints."

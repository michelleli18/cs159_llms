  "reasoning": "The placement was carefully considered based on the relative sizes and logical placements of each subitem in real-life scenarios. Entrances were placed at the far left side to allow easy access to the dorms. Common Areas were distributed along the entrance path, making them easily accessible from different entry points. Study Rooms were placed nearby the Common Areas to facilitate easy transitions between study and relaxation. The Laundry Room is placed centrally within the dorms for easy access. Bedrooms were strategically placed at the upper levels of the map for privacy, with Bathrooms located nearby for convenience. Kitchens were allocated alongside Common Areas for ease of access to cooking facilities. Lounges were dispersed to allow for relaxation across different areas of the dorms. Each subitem is within the boundary and no subitems overlap each other, fulfilling the primary requirement. Unused space was minimized, aligning with the design's efficient and logical use of space."

  "reasoning": "The Dairy Aisle is located within the coordinates [12, -9, 18, -3]. It encompasses various sections that are essential in a dairy section of a supermarket. The largest items, 'Milk Section', 'Cheese Section', and 'Yogurt Section', are the bigger sections and are placed adjacent to each other on the bottom row from left to right to mimic real-life placement where these are usually displayed in a row consecutively. This also allows efficient access for the customers. 'Butter Section' and two instances of 'Eggs Section' are in the next row because eggs and butter often come in more compact sections and are arranged in a way that utilizes space efficiently while ensuring the items are logically grouped together. The 'Cream Section' is a relatively smaller section and fits well next to the eggs. 'Non-Dairy Alternatives' take up the remaining space in the corner, as it is a larger section and it makes sense to place it separately from traditional dairy products for clear differentiation. All items are within the boundary of their parent coordinates and do not overlap. This configuration efficiently uses space while maintaining logical coherency among groups of subitems."

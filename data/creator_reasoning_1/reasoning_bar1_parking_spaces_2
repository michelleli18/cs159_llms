  "reasoning": "To ensure all subitems fit within the given coordinates [26, -9, 28, -6], 'Car1' and 'Car2' were placed next to each other taking up the bottom row to maximize usage of the long side. Their size of 6 demands a full row. 'Parking Lines' were fit logically between the cars and against the upper wall efficiently using the remaining space, they were split into two to maintain the non-overlapping nature - 'Parking Lines' and 'Parking Lines 2'. 'Parking Sign' though smaller was placed between 'Parking Lines' to utilize the leftover narrow space (along y-axis). The spatial distribution was done maintaining relativity while keeping a practical perspective for a parking area; ensuring access and visibility for each item. 'Parking Sign' being essential is central and small, thus put next to the lines, for realistic sign placement."

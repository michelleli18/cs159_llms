    "reasoning": "Given the coordinates and area of the college, we aimed to distribute the subitems logically, utilizing their relative sizes and ensuring no overlap. The layout starts on the left-bottom and builds upwards and rightwards for increasing sizes and logical grouping. The Library, Lecture Hall, and Cafeteria are placed contiguous to each other in the first row, facilitating easy student foot traffic between these major areas for studying, learning, and dining. The Dormitory is adjacent to the Cafeteria in the same row for student convenience. The Sports Field is one of the largest areas and anchors the second row, needing a larger expanse. Laboratories and the Administrative Building are also placed nearby for academic and administrative purposes. Parking Lot, being a sizeable necessity, starts the third row, followed by the Student Center to promote ease in accessing student services. The coverage has been maximized while adhering to the constraints and keeping pathways for movement."

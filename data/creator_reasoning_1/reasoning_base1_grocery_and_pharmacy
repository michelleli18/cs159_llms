  "reasoning": "The Produce Section is placed at the lower left corner as it is often the first section in a grocery store. With a relative size of 8, it occupies a significant space but still allows for other sections to fit. The Dairy Aisle is adjacent to Produce Section for easy access to fresh produce and dairy products, with a size of 7. Frozen Foods, which has a size of 6, is placed next to the Dairy Aisle to maintain a logical flow of refrigerated sections together. Bakery Section, with a size of 4, is positioned in the bottom right quadrant near the Meat Counter, effectively using the width of the store without wasting space. The Meat Counter is placed in the far right, ensuring wider aisles for the often busy meat section and utilizing vertical space. Pharmacy Counter, being the smallest section with a size of 2, is positioned more centrally, ensuring easy access from both grocery and checkout lanes. Finally, the Checkout Lanes, with a size of 3, are positioned at the top-right near the exits for convenience and flow, occupying the remainder space efficiently. All subitems are within the boundaries of the parent area and there are no overlaps, fulfilling all the stated priorities."

    "reasoning": "The 'Conference Table' is placed centrally (31, -2, 33, 1) because it is the largest and focal point of the room where most meetings take place. 'Chairs' are added surrounding the table for seating purposes, with placements (31, -3, 32, -2), (32, -3, 33, -2), (31, 1, 32, 2), and (32, 1, 33, 2) covering all sides and ensuring attendees can sit around the table. The 'Projector Screen' (31, 2, 32, 3) is positioned close to one side of the table for easy visibility during presentations, while the 'Whiteboard' (32, 2, 33, 3) is placed opposite the screen for collaborative discussions. The 'Cabinet' (31, -1, 32, 0) and 'Cabinet 2' (32, -1, 33, 0) are placed near the entrance to store necessary supplies and equipment. This efficient arrangement ensures all items fit within the bounds of the room, with no overlaps while maximizing use of available space."

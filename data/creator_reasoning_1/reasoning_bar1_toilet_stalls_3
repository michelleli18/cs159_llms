The subitem 'Toilet Stalls' is divided into two due to its relative size of 6. Each 'Toilet Stall' occupies a space with the height of 1 unit. 'Toilet Stalls 1' is placed at the bottom left corner, while 'Toilet Stalls 2' is placed adjacent to 'Toilet Stalls 1' to the right, using the available space efficiently. 'Sink Counter' with a size of 4 is centered to balance the design and to be easily accessible. The 'Entry Door' is placed on the right edge to allow easy entrance and exit, sticking to the bottom right of the coordinate. 'Hand Dryers' is smaller with a size of 1 and is positioned next to 'Toilet Stalls 1' for convenience after using the toilet. Similarly, 'Trash Bins' with a size of 1 is placed adjacent to 'Sink Counter' on the bottom right side to ensure that paper towels from the 'Hand Dryers' can be disposed of conveniently. This layout ensures efficient use of space with all coordinates being within the defined boundaries and no subitems overlapping."}

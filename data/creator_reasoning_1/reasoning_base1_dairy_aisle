  "reasoning": "The layout was designed to ensure all subitems fit within the parent Dairy Aisle with no overlap and making efficient use of space. The Milk Shelf is the largest subitem, so it was placed in the bottom left corner to utilize the longer horizontal space efficiently. Cheese Display and Yogurt Section were placed adjacent to each other in the middle section to keep dairy products together and utilize vertical space. Eggs Shelf was placed next to Cheese Display to keep all dairy and related items in proximity. Butter Shelf and Cream Shelf, being the smallest, were placed at the top right and used the remaining space efficiently. This arrangement ensures optimal use of space and logical placement of related items together, mimicking real-life store layout for customer convenience."

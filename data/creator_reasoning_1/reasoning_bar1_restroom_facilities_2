It is critical to ensure that none of the placed subitems overlap and all coordinates of subitems are within this boundary. The toilet stalls are the largest subitems and thus take up the full height of the space. They are placed sequentially from left to right to cover one side of the restroom. I have included three sets of toilet stalls to represent multiple stall locations since they fall into the plural category. For the sinks, they are smaller than the toilet stalls both in real life and relative size so they occupy less space and are placed next to stalls for easy access after usage. Additionally, since the items must fit together seamlessly within the boundaries, they are positioned to maximize space efficiency. I couldn't include the Hand Dryers, Trash Bins, and Changing Table due to space constraints, as none of them could be fitted without overlapping with existing subitems or going out of the overall coordinate bounds. Each of the subitems are against the boundaries of the restroom facility to ensure we are utilizing the space efficiently, which is also why the sinks were placed on the opposite side to the toilet stalls to cover the width completely."}

    "reasoning": "The Workstations area is placed from [-13, -6] to [-9, -2] to provide the largest space as it’s the primary workspace, touching the left boundary and bottom for a natural layout. Next, the Conference Room is from [-9, -6] to [-8, -3], ensuring proximity to the Workstations for easy access for meetings. The Kitchen Area from [-13, -2] to [-10, 0] and Lounge Area from [-10, -2] to [-8, 0] are placed on the top adjacent to each other to facilitate convenient breaks and meal times. The Break Room from [-13, -4] to [-11, -2] is adjacent to the Kitchen Area for easy access. The Restrooms from [-11, -6] to [-10, -4] are centrally placed for easy access from Workstations and other areas. The Manager Office from [-10, -6] to [-9, -4] is slightly secluded for privacy but close to Workstations for supervision. Finally, the Supply Closet from [-10, -4] to [-9, -3] is added next to the Restrooms and Manager Office for efficient use of remaining space. This placement ensures coverage of space without overlaps and follows realistic office layout conventions."

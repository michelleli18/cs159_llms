    "reasoning": "The placement was done considering item sizes and logical spacing. The Parking Lot, being the largest, was divided into two to fit along the side. It's essential for accessibility, so it's placed at the entry closer to the bottom left. Next, the Playground, a necessity close to the parking lot, offers immediate activity for families. The Restroom Area is placed nearby for easy access, with the Shelter Pavilion close to provide shade and seating. The Barbecue Grills are placed conveniently near the Pavilion for group gatherings. Finally, the Picnic Tables are closely positioned around the Pavilion to offer seating for meals. The provided space is used efficiently, with clear separation to ensure no overlaps and all coordinates are within the parent boundary."

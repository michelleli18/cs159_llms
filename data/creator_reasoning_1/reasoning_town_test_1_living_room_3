  "reasoning": "The placement of the subitems within 'Living Room 3' is designed to optimize space utilization while adhering to the constraints of non-overlapping and fully enclosed coordinates. The 'Couch' is placed along the bottom left corner from coordinates [-25, -21] to [-20, -17] to provide ample seating and anchor the central part of the living room. Adjacent to the 'Couch', at the bottom right corner from coordinates [-19, -21] to [-17, -18] is the 'Tv Stand,' positioned logically for viewing from the couch. The 'Coffee Table' fits snugly between the couch and middle space from coordinates [-24, -19] to [-21, -17] to provide easy access for users seated on the couch. The 'Bookshelf' is placed along the bottom left to middle left side from coordinates [-23, -21] to [-19, -18], next to the wall, utilizing otherwise potentially unused vertical space and allowing for efficient storage. Lastly, the 'Armchair' is placed in the bottom center from coordinates [-21, -21] to [-19, -20], between the 'Couch' and the 'Tv Stand', providing additional seating in a functional and space-efficient manner. Each item's size and position mimic real-life living room furniture arrangement, ensuring easy flow and interaction between all components."

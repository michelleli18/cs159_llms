  "reasoning": "The 'Study Table' is placed in the bottom left corner (coordinates: [34, 6, 35, 8]), making efficient use of the available space. Due to the requirement of 3 'Chairs', they are placed vertically next to the 'Study Table' in a stacked manner with coordinates [35, 6, 35, 7], [35, 7, 35, 8], [35, 8, 35, 9] to save space. 'Bookshelves' are placed adjacent to 'Chairs' on the right side, spanning horizontally along the bottom part of the room with coordinates [35, 6, 37, 7]. The 'Whiteboard' is placed above the 'Bookshelves' with coordinates [35, 7, 37, 8] for ease of access and visibility. Finally, 'Windows' are placed above the 'Whiteboard' with coordinates [35, 8, 37, 9] to allow natural light into the room."

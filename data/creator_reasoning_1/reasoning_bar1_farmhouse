    "reasoning": "The Barn is the largest structure, so it is placed at the bottom-left corner of the parent area, utilizing the more extensive horizontal space. The Farmhouse, which is the main building, has a slightly smaller area than the barn and is placed to the right of the barn, taking advantage of the vertical space. The Chicken Coop, relatively smaller, is placed above the farmhouse, ensuring vertical stacking without overlap. The Vegetable Garden, which needs to be easily accessible and is larger than the Chicken Coop or Tool Shed, is placed to the left of the Barn. The Tool Shed, being the smallest of the items, is positioned in the remaining space between the garden and the farmhouse. This placement ensures all subitems fit flush to the parent area's walls without any overlap while covering the space effectively. The Animal Pen could not be included due to the lack of available space."

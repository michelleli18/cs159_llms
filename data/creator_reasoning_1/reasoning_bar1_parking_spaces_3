  "reasoning": "The original place 'Parking Spaces 3' has a coordinate boundary of [28, -9, 30, -6]. The most important consideration is that all subitems must fit within these boundaries and not overlap with each other. For the 'Parking Space 1', 'Parking Space 2', and 'Parking Space 3', all three are sized equally at 8 out of 10, which means they require considerable space. Given the place size of 2x3 units, each parking space is allocated a 1x2 unit space. 'Parking Space 1' is placed in the bottom-left corner [28, -9, 29, -7], next to it on the right is 'Parking Space 2' at [29, -9, 30, -7]. 'Parking Space 3' is positioned in the next available position above 'Parking Space 1' at [28, -7, 29, -6]. Considering the remaining space and prioritizing the realistic placement, 'Car 1' is placed at [29, -7, 30, -6], making logical use of the available space and ensuring it fits within the boundary. 'Car 2' was excluded as there was no more available space to fit it within the parent boundary without causing overlap."

  "reasoning": "Starting from the bottom left corner, the largest item 'Floor Space' was placed first to cover the majority of the available space. Due to its size, it's placed from [-29, -21] to [-27, -20]. Next, 'Wall Cabinets' which is the second largest, is placed from [-29, -20] to [-28, -19] along the top left area to utilize the vertical space efficiently. 'Shelves' are placed next to 'Wall Cabinets' from [-28, -20] to [-27, -19] as they are usually adjacent in pantry settings for ease of access. The 'Pantry Door', which is an essential access point, is located on the bottom side from [-29, -19] to [-28, -20]. Lastly, 'Storage Bins' are placed to the right of 'Floor Space' in coordinates [-28, -21] to [-27, -20] for convenient access from the door. All coordinates are within the parent boundaries, cover the maximum area with minimal empty space, and no items overlap, fulfilling the requirements."

  "reasoning": "The subitems were placed based on their relative sizes and logical positioning in a real living room. The sofa was positioned along the far left wall, taking up a significant amount of space as it is among the largest items. The coffee table was placed adjacent to the sofa to reflect typical living room layouts. The entertainment center, which is vital for a living room, was positioned at the far end to maximize visibility from the sofa. The bookshelf was placed near the top of the room, while the armchair and TV stand were placed in such a way to allow easy viewing of the entertainment center. The fireplace was placed along the right side, offering a cozy feel and making use of the available space efficiently. Lastly, the side table was placed in a smaller, leftover space. This arrangement ensures all items have designated spaces that make logical sense for a living room setting, while also covering the available walls and minimizing unused space."

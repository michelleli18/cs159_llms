  "reasoning": "All subitems are placed within the Cheese Section boundaries to avoid any overlaps and to ensure efficient space utilization. The Cheese Counter is placed along the bottom left corner to maximize use of space with ease of access. The Display Case is adjacent to the Cheese Counter, making it logical and natural for customers to walk through. The Refrigerated Shelves are placed adjacent to the Cheese Cutting Area, ensuring an efficient workflow for staff handling cheese cutting and stocking. The Sampling Station, due to its smaller size, is placed in an unoccupied minimal corner space. The layout ensures that no space is wasted and each subitem is logically positioned for ease of customer navigation."

    "description": "Finnian Dagmar is a 32-year-old Swedish-Italian computer programmer and amateur entomologist. His pronouns are he/him. He enjoys collecting rare insects and attending science fiction conventions in his free time. However, he has also thought about expanding his interests into urban gardening because he's curious about the benefits of fresh produce and the therapeutic aspects of gardening. He does not like crowded places because they trigger his anxiety and make him feel overwhelmed. He has also been working hard towards his long-term goals and dreams, which include creating a groundbreaking piece of software that revolutionizes educational technology and publishing a comprehensive field guide to European beetles. Personally, he owns an extensive collection of vintage comic books and several terrariums housing exotic insects at his home. Outside of home, he works at a cutting-edge tech startup specializing in educational software solutions. After work, he enjoys planning to go to different botanical gardens and nature reserves to do all his hobbies.",

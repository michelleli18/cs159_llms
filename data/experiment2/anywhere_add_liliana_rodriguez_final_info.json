    "description": "Liliana Rodriguez is a 29-year-old artist and muralist from Mexico City. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys painting large-scale murals, studying art history, and experimenting with mixed media in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into urban gardening and culinary arts because she loves the idea of combining aesthetics with sustainability and enjoys creating things that stimulate multiple senses. She does not like crowded tourist spots because she finds them overwhelming and prefers to discover hidden gems. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include opening an art school for underprivileged children and launching her own line of eco-friendly art supplies. Personally, she owns a collection of rare plants and an extensive library of art books at her home. Outside of home, she works at community centers revitalizing public spaces with her vibrant murals. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different parts of the city to sketch, take photographs, and gather inspiration for her next big project.",

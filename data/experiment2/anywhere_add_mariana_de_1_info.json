    "description": "Mariana De la Cruz is a 34-year-old Peruvian-Canadian cultural anthropologist. Her pronouns are she/her. She enjoys going on spontaneous road trips and painting abstract art in her free time. However, she has also thought about expanding her interests into rock climbing and organic gardening because she yearns for physical challenges and finds tranquility in nature. She does not like loud crowded spaces because they overwhelm her and disrupt her peace of mind. She has also been working hard towards her long-term goals and dreams, which include writing a book on indigenous cultures of South America and creating a community art space that incorporates diverse cultural expressions. Personally, she owns a collection of vintage postcards and a rescued greyhound named Luna at her home. Outside of home, she works at a university as a lecturer and researcher. After work, she enjoys planning to go to different places to do all her hobbies, often turning each new city she visits into a canvas of inspiration for her paintings.",

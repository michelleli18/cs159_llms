  "reasoning": "The coordinates of all subitems are confined within the parent coordinates [6, -3, 8, -1], ensuring no overlaps or out-of-bound placements. The Refrigerated Display occupies a significant portion of the space since it's essential for storing the yogurt. Next to it is the Yogurt Shelf, making logical sense for easy customer access to store and grab yogurt directly. The Cart Station and Signage Board are positioned above the Refrigerated Display and Yogurt Shelf, aiding customer navigation. Given that the Cart Station doesn't require much space, it fits neatly beside the Signage Board. The Exit Door is placed in proximity to the Cart Station and Signage Board for smooth customer flow. Lastly, the Product Bin is placed near the Exit Door, allowing customers to dispose of or deposit items conveniently before exiting. All areas are planned to maximize efficient use and logical adjacency, leaving minimal empty space while allowing necessary room for customer movements."

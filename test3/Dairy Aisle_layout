  "reasoning": "To ensure efficient and realistic placement, the Milk Section was placed first due to being one of the most frequented and thus requiring more space (2, -3, 4.4, -1). The Cheese Section was placed next to Milk with coordinates (4.4, -3, 6.8, -1) maintaining accessibility. Yogurt, slightly smaller, was placed alongside with coordinates (6.8, -3, 8, -1.75) since it's a common adjacent product to Cheese and Milk. Butter was placed vertically above Yogurt (6.8, -1.75, 8, 0) to efficiently use vertical space. The Egg Section was placed next to Milk but utilizing upper space since eggs tend to be placed near other frequently purchased items for quick access (2, -1, 4, 0). Cream Section follows Eggs using the next available vertical space (4, -1, 6, 0). Non-Dairy Alternatives were placed next to Cream (6, -1, 7, 0) to maintain a logical flow for shoppers looking for substitutes. Finally, Refrigeration Units occupy the remaining vertical space next to Non-Dairy Alternatives (7, -1, 8, 0). The varied sizes and logical placements ensure minimal empty space and efficient utilization of the Dairy Aisle's overall area."

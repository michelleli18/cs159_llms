    "reasoning": "The Milk Section is the largest subitem, so it occupies the leftmost part of the aisle from the bottom to the top, ensuring that the larger areas are efficiently used. It spans from the left side to the middle section of the aisle. The Cheese Section, being smaller than the Milk Section but still significant, is placed adjacent to the Milk Section on the right side, occupying the lower part, ensuring easy access since cheese is frequently brought with milk. Yogurt Section is placed next to the Cheese Section, taking up the remaining space above the lower Cheese Section to optimize space use while keeping similar dairy products next to each other. The Butter Section is placed above the Yogurt Section in the remaining smaller section of space, leaving space for Eggs Section that fits perfectly next to it on the top right. This arrangement makes sure that the space is maximized without any overlap and maintains logical adjacency for user convenience."

  "reasoning": "The 'Refrigerator Doors' are placed adjacent to the bottom of the left wall, occupying significant length along the y-axis since they are important for customer access to refrigerated items. 'Dairy Shelves' were placed next to the 'Refrigerator Doors' on their right side, securing easy access for refilling and picking items directly from the refrigerator to the shelves. The 'Milk Display' is placed next to the 'Dairy Shelves', as customers usually see the milk items prominently displayed next to other dairy products, making it easier for them to find what they need. The 'Aisle Floor' stretches across the bottom part from the x-coordinates 2 to 6 because it would provide ample walking space for customers to navigate through the section while browsing the available items. 'Signage Board' was excluded due to spatial constraints as adding it would lead to an overlapping or awkward placement contrary to our primary guideline."

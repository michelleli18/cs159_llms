    "reasoning": "The 'Refrigerators' are placed along the left bottom side [2, -3, 3, -2] because this is a larger and more critical area typically found at the start or end of milk sections. They need to be easily accessible and usually take up considerable space. The 'Milk Shelves' [3, -3, 3.7, -2] are placed adjacent to the 'Refrigerators' along the bottom wall, making use of the same length but distinguished enough to appear as a separate area. The 'Display Cases' [2, -2, 2.8, -1] are placed above the 'Refrigerators' and touch the left boundary, making the display visible immediately upon entrance when checking the refrigerators or shelves. Lastly, the 'Almond Milk Section' [2.8, -2, 3.6, -1] is placed to the right of the 'Display Cases' along the remaining space ensuring all coordinates fit within the parent layout while successfully separating the almond milk area from regular milk to maintain differentiation. The layout leaves minimal gaps ensuring all space is efficiently used and logically partitioned according to function and customer convenience."

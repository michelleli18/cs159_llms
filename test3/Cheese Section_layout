    "reasoning": "To ensure the best use of the available space and keeping in mind architectural logic, I carefully positioned and sized each subitem based on its relative importance and function. The 'Cheese Display Case' is the smallest and is placed in the bottom-left corner [6, -3, 6.8, -1.5] to effectively use the space. The 'Deli Counter', having the most foot traffic, is suitably positioned next [6.8, -3, 8, -1.5], adjacent to the Cheese Display Case, allowing easy access for customers. The 'Refrigerated Shelves' are positioned [6, -1.5, 7, -1] next to the Cheese Display Case because refrigerated items should be close to display items for customer convenience. Lastly, the 'Cheese Island Display' [7, -1.5, 8, -1] is placed in the remaining area adjacent to the Deli Counter for maximum use of the available area and logical flow. This layout ensures all items fit comfortably without overlap and uses up most of the available space efficiently."

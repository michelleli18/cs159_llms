  "reasoning": "The 'sofa' is placed along one side of the seating area as it is the largest item and should be a focal point. It spans 1.5 units in width and touches the left wall to maximize space. Next to the 'sofa', the 'coffee_table' is placed to create a common modern layout where coffee tables are adjacent or directly in front of sofas. The 'armchair' and its duplicate 'armchair 2' are placed side by side and flush against the bottom wall, providing additional seating without wasting space. The 'bookshelf' is positioned flush against the opposite wall for easy access and to fill remaining space effectively. Finally, the 'side_table' fills the remaining small gap between the 'armchair' and 'coffee_table', ensuring no awkward empty spaces. The choice of placement also considers common real-life arrangements where bookshelves are accessible but out of walkway areas, and tables are centrally located. The layout ensures efficient space utilization and practical furniture arrangement, adhering to the constraints while keeping the design modern and functional."

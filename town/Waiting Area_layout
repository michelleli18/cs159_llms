  "reasoning": "The 'seating_area' is the largest subitem, so it is divided into two parts to cover more space efficiently and placed along the width of the 'Waiting Area'. The 'reception_desk' is placed close to the entrance area to be easily accessible for the visitors, as it usually functions as the main point of contact. The 'magazine_table' is positioned next to the 'seating_area' to provide easy access to visitors seated in the waiting area. Two 'potted_plants' are placed at the corners to enhance the aesthetics of the area and fill the empty corners effectively. This layout ensures an efficient use of space and logical positioning of each subitem, keeping in mind functionality and aesthetics."

    "reasoning": "The primary considerations for placing these subitems are the relative sizes, logical placements, and effective utilization of the area defined by the parent coordinates. The 'Control Tower' is placed near the edge of the runway for visibility and strategic control, thus taking a smaller area. The 'Hangar' is relatively larger to accommodate aircraft and is placed adjacent to the 'Control Tower' for operational efficiency. 'Terminal Building' needs direct access to the runway, thus it is positioned close to both the runway and the 'Control Tower'. The 'Parking Apron' is quite large and is placed near the 'Hangar' to facilitate easy aircraft movement between the hangar and the parking area. The 'Runway 1 End' is logically placed alongside the 'Parking Apron' extending towards the end of the defined area. The 'Taxiway Intersection' is placed next to the 'Runway 1 End' for smooth aircraft taxiing. The 'Runway Lights' are essential for guiding planes and are centrally placed to serve their purpose efficiently, connecting 'Taxiway Intersection', 'Parking Apron', and 'Runway 1 End'. This arrangement ensures all items are within the parent coordinates and avoids overlapping, thus utilizing the space efficiently while maintaining logical operational flow."

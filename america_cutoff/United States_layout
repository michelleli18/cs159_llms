  "reasoning": "The placement and sizes of these subitems were based on their relative sizes and logical relationships. The 'School' is placed in the top left region because of its importance and size, occupying a large area. The 'Mall' is also large and is placed at the top right, acting as a central consumer hub. The 'Hospital' is close to the 'Mall' for accessibility and occupies a large but balanced space below the mall. The 'Park' is positioned centrally on the left lower half to provide community space. The 'House' is allocated a substantial area connecting the top regions and is placed near the 'School' for convenience. The 'Library' is centrally located but slightly smaller than the 'House' and 'Park' to serve as an accessible resource hub. 'Church' and 'Restaurant' are smaller and are logically placed towards the lower region, with 'Church' near the 'Park' for community access, and 'Restaurant' has a central position for accessibility. Everything is arranged such that the overall space is efficiently used with little empty space between subitems."

  "reasoning": "The seating areas are the most numerous subitems, so they have been distributed evenly around the circle to ensure ample seating from all directions. The concession stands are closest to the seating areas as spectators would need easy access to food and drinks. The scoreboards are placed adjacent to the concession stands for visibility to the audience seated closer to that side. The ticket booths are placed on the opposite side of the seating areas near the main entrances to the facility, allowing for smooth entry processes. Restrooms are distributed closer to the perimeter of the seating areas for convenience and easy access from various points. Merchandise kiosks are near the restrooms and seating areas to attract visitors heading for a break. This layout ensures all coordinates are within the boundaries of the central circle and maintains efficient space utilization while considering the logical placement and practical spatial relations of the subitems."

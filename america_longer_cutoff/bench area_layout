  "reasoning": "The benches are placed in an aligned row along the bottom of the square to make efficient use of space and for easy accessibility, simulating a realistic bench area where people can sit. The trash cans are placed nearby but with a small separation from the benches for convenience, ensuring the area stays clean. The flower beds occupy a vertical space since they require more area and provide an aesthetically pleasing separation between the sitting area and the outer boundaries of the place. The picnic tables are placed towards the left-hand side to make good use of the remaining space, ensuring they do not overlap with benches or flower beds. The spacing ensures all items fit within the designated coordinates without unnecessary empty gaps in between, following real-life architectural design principles."

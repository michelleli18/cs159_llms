  "reasoning": "The placement and sizing of subitems are determined by their relative importance, need for accessibility, and logical grouping. The largest areas are allocated to frequently visited places: 'Park' (covering half of the overall area), 'School', 'Hospital', and 'Shopping Mall' because these facilities serve the community in different ways. Schools and hospitals are essential for daily life, and thus they are centrally located. The 'Shopping Mall' is given a large space due to its commercial purpose. 'Library' is placed near the 'School' for accessibility to students. 'Office Building' shares space near the 'Library' to maintain a logical flow of work and study. 'House' and 'House 2' are placed together to simulate residential areas, and they are moderately sized. 'Parking Lot' is located centrally to serve multiple areas: near 'Library', 'Office Building' and 'Restaurant', enabling easy access. 'Restaurant' is placed close to residential areas and near the 'Shopping Mall' for convenience. The 'Gas Station' is strategically placed to be easily accessible. Each subitem is positioned to efficiently use the area, with the gaps carefully maintained to allow for navigation."

  "reasoning": "The priority was to ensure all subitems fit within the boundaries of the penalty box and do not overlap. The subitems were placed logically and based on their relative sizes. The penalty benches were placed at the bottom left because they are relatively small and fit well side by side in a row of three. The glass partition was placed on the right side from bottom to top, as it is relatively tall vertically. The scoreboard is placed adjacent to the glass partition but more centralized, making it easily viewable for both teams. The team benches were placed above the penalty benches next to each other across the wider section of the structure. The remaining space was used for the ice rink, which needed a significant portion of the area. The positioning ensures maximum efficiency and logical grouping, with no empty spaces adjacent to the walls to ensure full use of the provided space."

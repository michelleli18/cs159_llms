  "reasoning": "Firstly, I ensured all items were placed within the specified coordinates of the Garage [-35, 20, -30, 30] and checked for overlap. The 'Car' is the largest item and most logically placed near the entrance, occupying the bottom-left corner space [-35, 20, -31, 24]. The 'Bike' is placed next to the 'Car' since it's common to park a bike near the car for convenience [-31, 20, -30, 23]. The 'Workbench' is given ample space in the upper-left corner [-35, 24, -32, 30] as it requires more area for functionality. The 'Tool cabinet' is placed centrally adjacent to the 'Workbench' for easy access to tools while working [-32, 24, -30, 27]. Finally, the 'Shelves' are placed in the remaining top-right area [-32, 27, -30, 30] to maximize space usage and keep tools and supplies organized and easily reachable. This layout ensures efficient use of space while keeping logical and natural placement, fulfilling all the priorities outlined."

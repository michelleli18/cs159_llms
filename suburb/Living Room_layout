  "reasoning": "The initial coordinates of the Living Room are allocated to ensure sufficient room for each subitem while adhering to the constraints. The sofa occupies the bottom-left corner as it is a large and essential piece of furniture, followed by the coffee table adjacent to it in a typical living room setup. The television is placed opposite the sofa for easy viewing. The bookshelf is located in the top-left corner as it often requires less frequent access but can be a significant decorative piece. The armchair is next to the coffee table, creating an accessible, cozy reading nook. The fireplace is placed on the top-right corner to centralize warmth in the room. Considering space constraints, the dining table has not been included as it would overcrowd the room."
